currently being tested in veterinary clinical trials as a treatment for osteosarcoma (Paoloni et al. 2010).A veterinary clinical trial is underway to assess the side effect profile and effects on age-associated cardiac function following 10 weeks of rapamycin treatment in healthy elderly dogs (Kaeberlein 2015).', 'Rapamycin is used clinically to prevent organ transplant rejection, for some forms of cancer, and to prevent restenosis in cardiac stents (Kaeberlein 2013b).Shortterm treatment with the rapamycin derivative RAD001 improves ageassociated decline in immune function, as measured by antibody response to an influenza vaccine, in healthy elderly people (Mannick et al. 2014).', 'To date, only one study has been performed assessing the impact of a rapamycin derivative on healthy aging in people.In this trial, it was observed that 6 weeks of treatment with the rapamycin derivative RAD001 (everolimus) was sufficient to enhance function of the aged immune system, as assessed by response to an influenza vaccine (Mannick et al. 2014).This recapitulates what was observed in elderly mice (Chen et al. 2009), and suggests that at least some of the mechanisms by which rapamycin delays aging in mice work similarly in humans.Although both compounds have essentially identical biological activities, RAD001 was used in this study instead of rapamycin because the study was funded by Novartis, who holds the patent rights for RAD001 (rapamycin is now off patent and sold as a generic drug).The doses of RAD001 used in the human immune aging study were lower than those typically used to prevent organ transplant rejection and showed improved side effect profiles, although some adverse effects, including the presence of mouth sores in a subset of the patients, were noted.', 'This trial is designed to determine whether treatment with the drug rapamycin (see Table 1) can significantly reduce age-related disease and disability as well as mortality in middle-aged large dogs.The initial phase of this trial, which is in progress at the time of this writing, is intended to enroll at least 32 dogs 6 years of age or older and 40 lb in weight or greater.Each animal receives an initial veterinary exam and comprehensive blood work along with a cardiac exam including echocardiography (Fig. 3).Those dogs that do not present with any abnormalities or significant pre-existing health conditions are randomized into either placebo or rapamycin treatment groups for a 10-week treatment period.Initial rapamycin dosing regimens were determined, in part, based on pharmacokinetic analysis of rapamycin treatment in healthy dogs (Larson et al. 2016).After 10 weeks in the study, each dog receives another full exam and blood chemistry panel as well as repeat cardiac exam.The primary goals of this first phase are to establish appropriate dosing of rapamycin in the absence of significant adverse events and to determine whether similar improvements in cardiac function are achieved in aged dogs after 10 weeks of rapamycin treatment, as has been observed in laboratory mice (Dai et al. 2014;Flynn et al. 2013).', 'Fig. 3 Design of the current

the same generic rapamycin (sirolimus) pill that is provided to human patients.Asterisk Serum and feces are collected at each appointment for future metabolomic and microbiome analyses and for

to carefully assess the extent to which rapamycin improves health and reduces mortality in middle-age companion dogs.In addition to cardiac function, assessments of multiple age-related phenotypes will be performed including measures of cognitive function, muscle function, kidney function, glucose homeostasis, and cancer incidence.Many of these parameters are beneficially impacted by rapamycin in aging mice (Johnson et al. 2015), and we predict that rapamycin will induce similar improvements in aging dogs.', 'Rapamycin is currently the most effective pharmacological intervention for extending lifespan and delaying a broad range of age-related functional declines in rodents (Johnson et al. 2013).However, the doses used clinically to prevent organ transplant rejection are associated with side effects, such as impaired wound healing, edema, elevated circulating triglycerides, impaired glucose homeostasis, gastrointestinal discomfort, and mouth ulcers (Augustine et al. 2007;de Oliveira et al. 2011).These adverse side effects would likely preclude long-term use of rapamycin at these levels in otherwise healthy people.With the possible exception of impaired glucose homeostasis (Lamming et al. 2012), these side effects have not been observed at doses that are associated with increased lifespan and healthspan in mice, however, raising the possibility that lower doses of this drug could promote healthy aging with minimal adverse effects.', 'Rapamycin  Rapamycin is a macrolide isolated from Streptomyces hygroscopicus, a bacteria from Pascua Island (Rapa

context: ['FUTURE DIRECTIONS: HIGHER RESOLUTION DATA VIA HIGHER THROUGHPUT ASSAYS  One inescapable conclusion of the aggregate results of genome-wide studies of aging to date (see summary Table 1) is that we have not come close to saturating the number of potentially lifespan-altering genes in any organism.This is in no small part because directly generating survival curves is a relatively time-consuming process in most model organisms using current methods.There are several possible ways to address this.One way that has been tried is by attempting to find surrogate phenotypes [72,73,126] that can be screened more rapidly, or even scored under selection.Another is mining candidates from the many whole-genome expression profiles.Results to date with these have been very fruitful, but have not suggested that these methods alone will rapidly saturate our search for lifespan-and healthspan-altering genes in tractable model organisms.', 'Genetic linkage studies of long-lived human families identified a longevity locus while candidate gene approaches have been used to identify and confirm the association between specific variants in the FOXO3A gene and human longevity [3–7]. Genome-wide association studies have also been used to identify the association of APOE with life  123 Aging Clin Exp Res  span and have yielded insights into potential biological pathways and processes related to aging. Despite these successes, several problems are inherent in human longevity studies including potentially high degrees of environmental heterogeneity, genetic diversity, and lack of birth matched controls, among others [8].', 'Additional association studies with these families and replication of these results with an independent data set should facilitate the positional cloning of a gene that influences the ability to age well and achieve exceptional longevity.Identification of the genes in humans that allow certain individuals to live to extreme old age should lead to insights on cellular pathways that are important to the aging process.', 'The aging process most certainly is under highly polygenic controls… This should not discourage us from pursuing a search for those loci which may be of profound importance to human aging as it ordinarily occurs in most human beings.', 'In most experimentally modified animal model systems, single-gene mutations in many different genes have major life extension effects (Fontana et al., 2010;Kenyon, 2010).However, natural human and animal longevity is presumed to be a complex trait (Finch & Tanzi, 1997).In humans, both candidate gene and genome-wide genetic association approaches have been applied in an attempt to identify longevity loci.The frequency of genetic variants has been typically compared between nonagenarian cases and young controls, revealing loci at which genetic variants may contribute to a higher or lower probability of survival into old age.The initial candidate gene studies aimed at finding human longevity genes were dominated by contradictory results (Christensen et al., 2006).The more consistent evidence obtained by repeated observation in independent cohort studies for association with longevity has so far only been observed for three loci, the apolipoprotein E (APOE) locus (Schachter et al., 1994;Christensen et al., 2006), the FOXO3A locus (Willcox et al., 2008;Flachsbart et al., 2009;Pawlikowska et al., 2009;Soerensen et al., 2010), and the AKT1 locus (Pawlikowska et al., 2009).Thus, despite the expectation that longevity would be influenced by many genetic variants with small effect sizes, the effect of variants has consistently been shown in only three genes.', '1993), and gene expression microarrays (Pletcher et al. 2002). Given the ambiguities and limitations of large-effect mutant studies of aging, discussed earlier, those publications do not provide very useful evidence with respect to the question of the number of loci that affect aging. At present, the best answer to the question of the number of genes controlling aging is many (Rose and Long 2002), in keeping with the original expectations of evolutionary biologists. However, studies of the genetics of the experimental evolution of aging are now amenable to the application of genomic methods.', 'Accepted Article  © 2013 The Authors Aging Cell © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/Anatomical Society of Great Britain and Ireland over 90 years and 1,955 controls between 55 and 80 years did not reveal genome-wide significant loci (Newman et al., 2010) and neither did the analyses of all-cause mortality and survival free of major disease in this cohort (Walter et al., 2011).A smaller Dutch study of 403 nonagenarians and 1,670 controls younger than 65 years identified the APOE gene as a mortality locus (Deelen et al., 2011), which was confirmed in a German study of 763 long-lived individuals and 1,085 younger controls (Nebel et al., 2011) and a longitudinal study of 1,606 Danes showed that the effect size of this association increases at the highest ages (Jacobsen et al., 2010).Apparently, the influence of the common genetic variation on longevity is small which requires large meta-GWA studies for identification.Alternatively, rare genetic variants may play a more important role in longevity.Since the previous linkage studies showed contradictory results potentially due to heterogeneity in the longevity phenotype, it is expected that longevity is influenced by many private rare variants.', 'The lack of success in the identification of genes related to aging in humans may be due to the complexity of the phenotype.One approach to investigate aging and longevity is to compare frequencies of genetic variants between nonagenarians or centenarians and the general population.This approach led to the discovery of an association between APOE (Deelen et al., 2011;Ewbank, 2007;Gerdes et al., 2000) and more recently FOXO3A (Anselmi et al., 2009;Flachsbart et al., 2009;Li et al., 2009a;Pawlikowska et al., 2009;Willcox et al., 2008) and human aging and longevity.However, a recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) of individuals reaching the age of 90 or older failed to identify genome-wide significant variants (Newman et al., 2010).', 'Several explanations are possible for the lack of genomewide significant findings.First, mortality is arguably 1 of the most complex phenotypes, and several trajectories toward extreme old age have been identified (Evert et al., 2003).Multiple genes could mediate the aging process but would have their effects through numerous different patho-physiological processes and diseases that act as intermediate factors on the pathway to death (de Magalhaes et al., 2010).Therefore, any common variation in genes associated with aging probably has a small effect.', 'Second, the largely negative findings of this and other studies contrast with the intriguing animal studies of longevity.Very large effects of single genes on lifespan have indeed been observed in laboratory animals, but humans often have several homologues of these genes which might significantly differ in function or compensate for mutated genes through redundant mechanisms (Kuningas et al., 2008).This could explain why our top findings did not include genes in these pathways found in animal models.Animal models also represent genetically homogenous populations and are exposed to controlled environmental influences.The lack of replication of animal model findings in humans suggests that the use of knockout animals may not provide the optimal approach to understanding the variation in survival in humans as interactions with environmental factors may obscure the associations and prevent the identification of loci in humans.', '1993), and gene expression microarrays (Pletcher et al. 2002). Given the ambiguities and limitations of large-effect mutant studies of aging, discussed earlier, those publications do not provide very useful evidence with respect to the question of the number of loci that affect aging. At present, the best answer to the question of the number of genes controlling aging is many (Rose and Long 2002), in keeping with the original expectations of evolutionary biologists. However, studies of the genetics of the experimental evolution of aging are now amenable to the application of genomic methods.', 'The remarkable discoveries of the past 2 decades showing that single genes can regulate aging in model organisms demonstrate that aging can be genetically manipulated (Finch and Ruvkun, 2001;Kenyon, 2010).Hundreds of genes that modulate longevity have now been identified in model organisms (de Magalha ˜es et al., 2009a).In some cases (e.g., in worms), mutations in single genes can extend lifespan by almost 10-fold (Ayyadevara et al., 2008).Nonetheless, aging is a complex process that derives not from single genes but from the interactions of multiple genes with each other and with the environment.Evidence from animal systems shows a major impact of the environment on aging, yet environmental manipulations of aging act through genes and proteins, usually by triggering signaling pathways and modulating gene expression.In fact, some genes have been shown in model organisms to have varying effects on lifespan depending on diet (Heikkinen et al., 2009).Genes that can regulate aging in model organisms cannot be directly applied to humans through genetic manipulations for numerous legal, ethical, and technical reasons.If we could understand how the environment modulates these aging-related genes, we might be able to create antiaging therapies applicable to humans, potentially through diet, lifestyle, and even pharmacological interventions.Therefore, understanding genome-environment interactions in the context of aging can be a powerful approach to identify attractive targets for drug design.', "Results from mutational analysis across eukaryote model organisms have shown unexpected conservation of genes and processes regulating aging.While unique properties exist within particular organisms that modulate these foundational networks, the conservation provides a tool to refine human genetic studies.As noted, GWAS for human longevity metrics suffer from large sample size requirements to obtain statistical resolution due to multiple hypothesis testing across the genome.Assuming that evolutionary genesets for longevity could be generated with confidence, an intersection of them with human variation data would increase the sensitivity of association studies.This would serve as a selective filter to refine the number of loci investigated for association in human populations.Similarly, such evolutionary filters could refine analysis of rare, unique variation within genome sequence data from extremely long-lived cohorts.A similar approach to refine human longevity GWAS used an intersection with age-related disease datasets.This 'disease-informed' GWAS helped refine candidates (iGWAS, Fortney et al., 2015), though, it should be noted that this particular strategy would further blur the distinction between aging and longevity as discussed above.The definition of gene sets from evolutionary experiments in longevity, across clades, would similarly empower detection of networks previously hidden under GWAS in human population analyses (Figure 3).", "ANALYSIS OF HUMAN VARIATION IN THE GENETIC CONTROL OF LONGEVITY  Heritability studies have convincingly demonstrated that at least some fraction of human lifespan is heritable.In tandem, large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous loci associated with age-related traits (Buniello et al., 2019).While genetic studies have functionally shown an inverse effect of multiple age-related, diseaseassociated variants on lifespan regulation, the number of well-replicated longevity-conferring variants remains limited to variants in APOE (ApoE ε2), and more recently, CDKN2A/B and IL6 (see Table 1).To date, studies in humans have been hampered by the specific phenotype definitions used, sample sizes of the extreme phenotypes, and modest heritability of the longevity-related traits (Breitbach et al., 2019).This is due to the complex interplay of biological and social factors involved in human aging, as well as the limited power of GWAS, which require sampling thousands of subjects to achieve statistical significance (Breitbach et al., 2019).Genetic studies of aging have also been hindered by an inconsistent use of definitions of aging (reviewed in Baghdadi et al., 2020).The two main ways of conducting research on the genetics of longevity in human populations are by studying (i) the lifespan (continuous trait, years lived) and (ii) the longevity (dichotomous trait, i.e., being among the longest-lived individuals within a specific population).These complexities have limited the resolution and capability of broad association studies of human longevity.Importantly, these genomic analyses focus on a shift of survival in a population; these variables may be genetically distinct from the mechanisms establishing potential for longevity overall (Figure 1A).We argue that an understanding of this shift in lifespan as well as genetic mechanisms of regulating a species specific 'set points' (Figure 1B) will aid in the conceptual distinction of aging and longevity in humans.", 'TRANSLATION OF LONGEVITY MODEL ORGANISMS AND CORE AGING PATHWAYS  Genetic studies on lifespan have proven to be challenging.While longevity is a defining trait for a given species, the lifespan of individuals is of limited heritability, making analyses more difficult.Exceptional human life span, although a rare phenotype, is likely multifactorial; refined analyses are required to obtain statistically robust genomic signatures of longevity (Zhang et al., 2020) and these have proven elusive.Unlike laboratory models, the effect of environmental variance cannot be controlled in human studies, potentially masking purely biological aging mechanisms.Even laboratory models cannot replicate the complex "environment" of humans; it includes psychosocial, economic, and cultural factors, rather than strictly biological.These human-specific confounders are difficult or impossible to target in traditional model organisms.Despite these limitations, experimentally tractable model organisms have proven invaluable in deciphering the purely genetic contribution to lifespan, including genes and pathways conserved across the tree of life.', 'Our analyses show that it is extremely unlikely that there is a single gene harboring rare protein-altering variants shared by all supercentenarians but no controls.It is not surprising that a highly complex trait such as longevity is not explained by a single Mendelian gene.', 'With modern genomic technologies and largescale data analysis methods, it is possible to sift through the genes of populations to find the loci that act to postpone aging. [3]There are uncertainties with the comparison of populations with different rates of aging.However, it is superior to experimental designs that only consider age-dependence or dietary-response, without determining causal mechanisms.', 'Although the models data set comprises all genes (to our knowledge) shown by the time of the latest update to statistically increase longevity or alter the aging process in a noticeable way, in the human data set we try to evaluate whether a given intervention is affecting the aging process itself or not.For example, many mutations may increase longevity by decreasing the incidence of specific diseases, rather than by altering the basic process of aging (de Magalhães et al ., 2005a(de Magalhães et al ., , 2005b)).Therefore, the human data set is not merely an extension of the work conducted in model organisms and of its bibliography, but a manually selected list of the most pertinent human aging candidate genes, each presented with a higher annotation level.We cite studies on whether the functions of aging-associated genes in model organisms are conserved in their human orthologues.Likewise, we cite flaws in previous studies based on new published observations, although we have a neutral stance on conflicting findings from different research groups.Our policy is to cite all conflicting reports and let visitors make their own decisions on how to interpret them.By contrast, each entry in GenAge model organisms has only one reference: the first publication reporting an association of the gene with longevity or aging.Moreover, one of the latest enhancements in the human data set was the inclusion of Gene Ontology annotation.Gene Ontology terms and annotation files were obtained from the Gene Ontology Consortium website (http://www.geneontology.org/ ) and provide an additional layer of description for the gene products in a cellular context (Ashburner et al ., 2000).', 'Conclusions and prospects  Over the past two decades the human aging field has built up the necessary resources to study the biology of aging and longevity by establishing human populations with a diversity of designs.Meta-analyses integrating genetic and phenotypic datasets have successfully identified variants associated with a range of age-related traits and diseases.Despite these accomplishments, the number of novel leads contributing to human lifespan regulation is limited.Although positive regions of linkage and suggestive GWAS hits have been reported, the field has not yet identified the loci that explain the clustering of longevity in families and the variation in biological aging rate in the population.As for animal models, down-signaling of the IIS and mTOR pathway appeared to be relevant in humans.These findings are being followed up by molecular and physiological profiling using skin, fat and muscle tissue of long-lived family members and controls.Human studies now also include the response of nutrient sensing systems to the application of dietary and physical challenges.', 'Most of the human candidate gene studies were performed in cross-sectional designs (Box 1 and Fig. 1), comparing allele frequencies of potential longevity loci between highly aged individuals and young controls.The candidate gene studies based on single genes have pointed a role for genes involved in, e.g., GH/insulin/IGF-1 signaling, immune regulation, and lipoprotein metabolism (Supporting Information Table S1), although most of these results have not (yet) been confirmed in sufficient independent studies.The most convincing human longevity loci today are APOE and FOXO3A which have frequently been associated with longevity in cross-sectional studies (see for a review [26]) and survival in prospective studies [27][28][29] (Fig. 3).APOE encodes the protein apolipoprotein E which seems to play a role in e.g., lipoprotein metabolism, cognitive function, and immune regulation [30].FOXO3A encodes the protein forkhead box O3 which acts as a transcription factor for many different genes involved in processes like apoptosis and oxidative stress [31].'], prompt: Consider the given context and following statements, then determine whether they are supported by the information present in the context.

Since QTL for longevity in mice have shown strong sex specificity [10, 12], we conducted sex-specific analyses.

To confirm the associations of the loci of interest with longevity and pathology, we performed replication analyses on a panel of BXD recombinant inbred strains.', 'Methods We examined a population of 1200 mice that were F2 generation offspring of a 4-way reciprocal cross between C57BL6/J and DBA2/J strains.

Burn, C.C. , 2008.', 'Our own work has taken a different tack: we have attempted to determine whether mutations with differential effects on aging may be present within the many available populations of laboratory-adopted inbred mice.The goal is not so much to clone these genes-if indeed they existbecause positional cloning strategies of this kind require many thousands of animals and would be extremely expensive using an assay, age at death, that is itself so costly.Instead, the goal has been to use gene mapping methods to test hypotheses about aging and to develop new animal models that will be useful for testing well-specified hypotheses about the molecular basis for age-dependent changes.In the absence of a validated battery of biomarkers of aging, we (like most others) have reluctantly decided to use mouse life span as a crude surrogate for aging itself, reasoning that genetic alleles that extend life span well beyond the median for the tested population may be operating via an influence on aging itself.Work conducted using recombinant inbred mouse stocks (Gelman et al., 1988;de Haan and Van Zant, 1999) has suggested that life-span differences between pairs of inbred mouse lines might reflect the influence of as few as 4-7 polymorphic loci, providing some basis for hope that some of these would have an effect large enough to be detected by a genome scan experiment involving 300-1,200 mice.', "The available dataset also provides examples in which genetic variants seem to influence the risk of specific late-life diseases.Figure 8-6, for example, shows longevity results for mice stratified by their inheritance at the 12th chromosome locus D12Mit167.This is a locus associated with differential longevity in both male and female mice, with the strongest effect (adjusted p < 0.01) seen in those mice living more than 657 days (Jackson et al., unpublished results).The longest-lived mice are those that inherit both the C57BL/6 allele from their mother and the C3H allele from their father; on average, they survive 93 days longer than siblings with the BALB plus C3H combination.Figure 8-6 shows that the D12Mit167, like the pair of loci illustrated in Figure 8-5, has significant and similar effects in mice dying of cancer (85 days) and in mice dying of non-neoplastic diseases (126 days).A more detailed analysis of the cancers, however, suggests that while lymphoma and hepatoma victims are equally protected by the favorable alleles (effect sizes of 93 and 167 days, respec-  mice of two subgroups: those dying of the urinary syndrome MUS, and those dying of all other causes.The genetic analysis contrasts mice with both the C57BL/6 allele at D4Mit84 and the C3H allele at D9Mit110 to mice with any of the three other allele combinations.In the males dying of causes other than MUS, this allele pair is associated with a 170-day increment in longevity (post-hoc p < 0.00003).But for males that do die of MUS, the same allele combination is associated with a 187-day decline in mean life span (post-hoc p < 0.03).This effect is thus pleiotropic, in that these alleles accelerate death in mice susceptible to MUS, while postponing death for all other males in the population.Although these loci are associated with differential longevity in mice that do develop MUS, they do not have a significant effect on the chances that MUS will indeed occur (not shown).The risk of developing MUS seems to be under control of a separate locus on chromosome 6.As shown in the bottom panel of Figure 8-7, males that inherit the C3H allele at D6Mit268 are far more likely to develop MUS (28 percent risk) than are their brothers who receive the DBA/2 allele at this locus (7 percent risk; p = 0.012 by two-tailed Fisher's exact test).", 'Previously, the methylation status of CpG sites within the genes Prima1, Hsf4, Kcns1 was shown to qualify as a reliable predictor of chronological age of B6 mice.10 This same study also revealed enhanced epigenetic aging of the D2 strain in accordance with its general reduced mean life span, supporting the possibility that the panel might also serve as a marker for the biological age in mice. Applying this B6trained marker panel to our (congenic) experimental strains, we observed that epigenetic age predictions correlated with chronological age in B6 (R2=0.93) and line A mice (R2=0.89).', '34.

A small number of age-dependent QTL were found in the midst of a majority of age-stable QTL (see discussion above). These age-sensitive loci point toward genes whose functions are correlated with important behavioral changes during aging.', 'Ageing genes and pathways.Assessing the loci of interest for colocalisation with gene expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), we find strong evidence (FDR SMR < 5%; P HEIDI > 1%; see "Methods") of cis-acting eQTL colocalisation for eight out of 10 loci.In total, we highlight 27 unique genes acting across 32 tissues, especially whole blood (12 genes) and the tibial nerve (7 genes) (Supplementary Data 5).In blood, higher expression levels of BCL3 and CKM (near APOE); CTC-510F12.2, ILF3, KANK2 and PDE4A (near LDLR); USP28 and ANKK1 (near ZW10); and CDKN2B are linked to an increase in multivariate ageing traits (i.e.improved survival), while the opposite is true for EXOC3L2 (near APOE), TTC12 (near ZW10), and FOXO3.For the multivariate signal near SLC4A7 we find colocalisation with expression of NEK10 (liver); for the signal near LPA we find colocalisation with expression of SLC22A1/A3 (multiple tissues) and MAP3K4 (pituitary); and for the signal near FGD6 we find colocalisation with expression of FGD6 itself (adipose/arterial).Including trans-acting eQTL from blood, while keeping the same thresholds for colocalisation, we additionally discover higher expression levels of FOXO3B colocalises with the life-extending signal near FOXO3.When we include genes which could not be tested for heterogeneity (N eQTL < 3), we identify one additional cis-acting and 49 additional trans-acting genes (of which 10 colocalise with the signal near LINC02513) (Table 2; Supplementary Data 5).', 'Jiang, C. and Zeng, Z.

context: ['Introduction  With the development of human genomics research, a large number of studies of the genetics of longevity have been conducted.Scientists from various countries have proposed many different theories concerning the mechanisms of aging from different perspectives, involving oxidative stress, energy metabolism, signal transduction pathways, immune response, etc. [1,2].These mechanisms interact with each other and are influenced by heredity to some degree [2,3].The identification of longevity-related biological markers is critical to an indepth understanding of the mechanisms of carrier protection against common disease and/or of the retardation of the process of aging.', 'INTRODUCTION  Human aging is affected by genes, life style, and environmental factors.The genetic contribution to average human aging can be modest with genes explaining ∼20-25% of the variability of human survival to the mid-eighties (Herskind et al., 1996;Fraser and Shavlik, 2001).By contrast, genetic factors may have greater impact on survival to the ninth through eleventh decades (Tan et al., 2008).Notably, exceptional longevity is rare and may involve biological mechanisms that differ from those implicated in usual human aging.', 'Introduction  Geroscience refers to research aimed at understanding the mechanisms of biological aging (Kennedy et al. 2014).A major goal of geroscience is to define the genetic, epigenetic, and environmental features that determine individual rates of aging.From a translational perspective, a further goal is to use this knowledge to develop interventions that can slow or delay aging in order to promote healthy longevity and increase healthspan, the period of life spent in good health free from chronic disease and disability

health and longevity follow largely two approaches which focus on the aging-related diseases and on individuals with exceptionally long lives (Martin et al. 2007).This study provides de facto the rationale for a new approach.Specifically, Fig. 2 suggests that a promising strategy could be to focus on individuals who died prematurely.Studies of genetic profiles of short-lived subjects compared to those who aged more successfully (i.e., those who lived longer and perhaps healthier lives) can be a core of this strategy.Importantly, this strategy can be naturally implemented in longitudinal studies of aging and longevity by focusing on individuals who died first.', 'T he average human life expectancy has been increasing for centuries 1 .Based on twin studies, the heritability of human lifespan has been estimated to be ~25%, although this estimate differs among studies 2 .On the other hand, the heritability of lifespan based on the correlation of the mid-parent (i.e., the average of the father and mother) and offspring difference between age at death and expected lifespan was estimated to be 12% 3 .A recent study has indicated that the different heritability estimates may be inflated due to assortative mating, leaving a true heritability that is below 10% 4 .The heritability of lifespan, estimated using the sibling relative risk, increases with age 5 and is assumed to be enriched in long-lived families, particularly when belonging to the 10% longest-lived of their generation 6 .To identify genetic associations with human lifespan, several genome-wide association (GWA) studies have been performed [7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20] .These studies have used a discrete (i.e., older cases versus younger controls) or a continuous phenotype (such as age at death of individuals or their parents).The selection of cases for the studies using a discrete longevity phenotype has been based on the survival to ages above 90 or 100 years or belonging to the top 10% or 1% of survivors in a population.Studies defining cases using a discrete longevity phenotype often need to rely on controls from more contemporary birth cohorts, because all others from the case birth cohorts have died before sample collection.Previous GWA studies have identified several genetic variants, but the only locus that has shown genome-wide significance (P ≤ 5 × 10 −8 ) in multiple independent meta-analyses of GWA studies is apolipoprotein E (APOE) 21 , where the ApoE ε4 variant is associated with lower odds of being a long-lived case.', 'Introduction  Worldwide human populations have shown an increase in mean life expectancy in the past two centuries (Oeppen & Vaupel, 2002).This is mainly because of environmental factors such as improved hygiene, nutrition, and health care.The large variation in healthy lifespan among the elderly has prompted research into the determinants of aging and lifespan regulation.The genetic contribution to human lifespan variation was estimated at 25-30% in twin studies (Gudmundsson et al., 2000;Skytthe et al., 2003;Hjelmborg et al., 2006).The most prominent genetic influence is observed in families in which the capacity to attain a long lifespan clusters (Perls et al., 2000;Schoenmaker et al., 2006).Exceptional longevity can be reached with a low degree of age-related disability (Christensen et al., 2008;Terry et al., 2008), raising the question whether protective mechanisms against disease exist in long-lived subjects.', "Introduction  Human life expectancies are increasing almost everywhere in the world where socio-economic circumstances are permissive (Tuljapurkar et al., 2000) and there is no evidence that a limit to life is anywhere near (Oeppen and Vaupel, 2002).While this increase in life span would prevent a proposed compression of morbidity (Fries, 1980), there is no evidence that higher average life spans are associated with an extension of the period of increased morbidity (Manton and Gu, 2001).On the contrary, older individuals have never been so healthy and further improvements in life style, environmental conditions and medical care are likely to help this trend to continue.Especially the medical sciences now seem poised to push the biological limits of longevity further by a number of innovations that seem to affect basic mechanisms of ageing and disease rather than merely alleviating its symptoms.While in the past medicine contributed mainly to public health advances by redu-cing infectious diseases, thereby helping infant mortality to decline, more recent developments hold promise for a more basic intervention in the processes that underlie age-related decline.An example is atherosclerosis, a common problem in ageing and, along with hypertension, the cause of most cardiovascular disease.Basic medical research has likely contributed significantly to the current dramatic decline in cardiovascular disease by actively intervening in some of its main risk factors, i.e., lipid levels and hypertension (Levi et al., 2002).However, one could question whether age-related diseases should be seen as separate from ageing.In this respect, ageing has been considered as a process of cellular degeneration and death universal to all or most species, increasing the risk of fatal disease in humans and other mammals.Would it be possible to define such a process and ultimately understand it in terms of the timedependent, coordinated action of the products of multiple genes interacting with the environment?If so, then ageing per se rather than the diseases associated with it, may offer a more logical starting point for further increasing healthy life expectancies through prevention and therapy.This is especially true now that we have a working draft of the human genome and are in a position to determine the functional significance of each gene as part of the dynamic network of all genes that ultimately determine the physiology of an organism.Termed 'Functional Genomics', this new discipline is now often called upon to solve the complex problems in biology, such as to understand functional control mechanisms and investigate the role that genotype and environment play in determining disease phenotypes.The question is then if this same approach would apply to ageing as a complex phenotype.What is ageing, how does it differ from its diametrical opposite, i.e., organismal development, and what role can functional genomics play in unraveling the basic causes of ageing and exploit such knowledge for developing new, rational strategies for extending healthy life span?", 'Introduction  As a result of improvements in health care and living conditions over the past two centuries, the average human life expectancy has dramatically increased in many regions of the world [1].This major success reflects the great malleability of the ageing process.Unfortunately, for most people, ageing is accompanied with an increased risk of developing age-related illnesses/disabilities and frailty.Therefore new approaches are required to understand the genetic, cellular, and molecular factors controlling ageing to identify strategies to extend healthy life span.', "The search for the genetic determinants of extreme human longevity has been challenged by the phenotype's rarity and its nonspecific definition by investigators.To address these issues, we established a consortium of four studies of extreme longevity that contributed 2,070 individuals who survived to the oldest one percentile of survival for the 1900 U.S. birth year cohort.We conducted various analyses to discover longevity-associated variants (LAV) and characterized those LAVs that differentiate survival to extreme age at death (eSAVs) from those LAVs that become more frequent in centenarians because of mortality selection (eg, survival to younger years).The analyses identified new rare variants in chromosomes 4 and 7 associated with extreme survival and with reduced risk for cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer's disease.The results confirm the importance of studying truly rare survival to discover those combinations of common and rare variants associated with extreme longevity and longer health span.", "The search for the genetic determinants of extreme human longevity has been challenged by the phenotype's rarity and its

attributed to the postponement of mortality at old age (Vaupel, 1997(Vaupel, , 2010)).The years of life gained in the older population residing in developed nations are a success story of public health measures and improved health care.In addition to such external factors, longevity and healthy aging consistently show a modest heritability between 20% and 50% and aging-associated genetic research may provide further insights into the mechanisms of aging (Herskind et al., 1996;McGue et al., 1993;Reed and Dick, 2003).It has been postulated that genes involved in pathways associated with aging identified in animal models, such as insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-insulin signaling, regulation of lipoprotein metabolism, the mTOR pathway, and the oxidative stress response may also influence survival to old or even exceptionally old age in humans (Christensen et al., 2006;Kenyon, 2010;Vellai et al., 2003).However, in humans, common variants within genes involved in these pathways have not been consistently associated with lifespan (Chris-tensen et al., 2006;Kenyon, 2010;Kuningas et al., 2008;Vijg and Suh, 2005).', 'DESIGNS TO STUDY PARAMETERS OF HEALTHY AGEING, MORBIDITY, MORTALITY AND LONGEVITY  Human cohorts may vary considerably in their morbidity, mortality and longevity characteristics and yet they have shown a common increase in mean life expectancy in the past two centuries [5].This is mainly due to improved hygiene, nutrition and healthcare.There is a large variation in healthy lifespan among the elderly and remarkably exceptional longevity (EL) can be reached with a low degree of agerelated disability [6,7].Heritability studies comparing the concordance of lifespan in monozygous and dizygous twins estimated a 25 -30% genetic contribution to human lifespan variation [8 -11], which becomes increasingly important at higher ages.The most prominent genetic influence is present in families in which survival to high ages clusters [12,13].Unlike model systems where single-gene mutations have major life extension effects, human longevity is presumed to be a complex trait [14].', 'INTRODUCTION  Genomic studies into human longevity are inspired by the fact that, in animal models, healthy lifespan has proved to be remarkably plastic, and major pathways of lifespan regulation have been identified.Considerable lifespan extension has been induced in models as diverse as yeast, worms, fish, flies and rodents by applying genetic manipulation and dietary restriction (DR) (see [1] for review).Reduced activity of nutrient-sensing pathways such as insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) signalling (IIS) and target of rapamycin (TOR) signalling mediated lifespan extension, and also the extension of lifespan by DR [2].An interesting observation from the perspective of human ageing is that, in rodents and monkeys, diets restricted in glucose, fat or protein uptake reduced or delayed the risk of cancer and metabolic disease, thus extending the healthspan of the animals [2].Following the discovery of genes and pathways involved in animal lifespan extension, human research has focused on the corresponding candidate human genes with genetic, genomic and epigenetic studies into ageing and longevity.The designs of these studies differ with respect to the selection of naturally occurring phenotypes and the study populations, which include population-based, patient-based, family-based and exposure-based cohorts.', 'GENETIC STUDIES OF HUMAN LONGEVITY  Genetic and genomic studies into longevity have been performed based on a hypothesis, referred to as a candidate gene approach.Alternatively, explorative genome-wide analyses have been applied in which genetic variation and gene transcription across the complete genome are being studied for associations with longevity and related traits.Genetic studies into human disease and longevity include candidate gene approaches, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and genome-wide linkage studies.', "ANALYSIS OF HUMAN VARIATION IN THE GENETIC CONTROL OF LONGEVITY  Heritability studies have convincingly demonstrated that at least some fraction of human lifespan is heritable.In tandem, large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous loci associated with age-related traits (Buniello et al., 2019).While genetic studies have functionally shown an inverse effect of multiple age-related, diseaseassociated variants on lifespan regulation, the number of well-replicated longevity-conferring variants remains limited to variants in APOE (ApoE ε2), and more recently, CDKN2A/B and IL6 (see Table 1).To date, studies in humans have been hampered by the specific phenotype definitions used, sample sizes of the extreme phenotypes, and modest heritability of the longevity-related traits (Breitbach et al., 2019).This is due to the complex interplay of biological and social factors involved in human aging, as well as the limited power of GWAS, which require sampling thousands of subjects to achieve statistical significance (Breitbach et al., 2019).Genetic studies of aging have also been hindered by an inconsistent use of definitions of aging (reviewed in Baghdadi et al., 2020).The two main ways of conducting research on the genetics of longevity in human populations are by studying (i) the lifespan (continuous trait, years lived) and (ii) the longevity (dichotomous trait, i.e., being among the longest-lived individuals within a specific population).These complexities have limited the resolution and capability of broad association studies of human longevity.Importantly, these genomic analyses focus on a shift of survival in a population; these variables may be genetically distinct from the mechanisms establishing potential for longevity overall (Figure 1A).We argue that an understanding of this shift in lifespan as well as genetic mechanisms of regulating a species specific 'set points' (Figure 1B) will aid in the conceptual distinction of aging and longevity in humans.", "Introduction  Human longevity is influenced by multiple genetic and environmental factors.Approximately 25-32% of the overall variation in adult lifespan is because of genetic variation that becomes particularly important for survival at advanced age (Hjelmborg et al., 2006).Epidemiological studies have revealed that long-lived individuals (LLI), that is, people surviving to the 95th percentile of the respective birth cohort-specific age distributions (Gudmundsson et al., 2000), frequently show a favorable ('healthy') course of the aging process, with the absence or a delayed onset of agerelated diseases (Hitt et al., 1999).Hence, the LLI offer the key to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the 'healthy aging' phenotype (Perls, 2006).", 'Conclusions and prospects  Over the past two decades the human aging field has built up the necessary resources to study the biology of aging and longevity by establishing human populations with a diversity of designs.Meta-analyses integrating genetic and phenotypic datasets have successfully identified variants associated with a range of age-related traits and diseases.Despite these accomplishments, the number of novel leads contributing to human lifespan regulation is limited.Although positive regions of linkage and suggestive GWAS hits have been reported, the field has not yet identified the loci that explain the clustering of longevity in families and the variation in biological aging rate in the population.As for animal models, down-signaling of the IIS and mTOR pathway appeared to be relevant in humans.These findings are being followed up by molecular and physiological profiling using skin, fat and muscle tissue of long-lived family members and controls.Human studies now also include the response of nutrient sensing systems to the application of dietary and physical challenges.', 'Human lifespan variation is mainly determined by environmental factors, whereas the genetic contribution is 25-30% and expected to be polygenic.Two complementary fields go hand in hand in order to unravel the mechanisms of biological aging: genomic and biomarker research.Explorative and candidate gene studies of the human genome by genetic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic approaches have resulted in the identification of a limited number of interesting positive linkage regions, genes, and pathways that contribute to lifespan variation.The possibilities to further exploit these findings are rapidly increasing through the use of novel technologies, such as next-generation sequencing.Genomic research is progressively being integrated with biomarker studies on aging, including the application of (noninvasive) deep phenotyping and omics data -generated using novel technologies -in a wealth of studies in human populations.Hence, these studies may assist in obtaining a more holistic perspective on the role of the genome in aging and lifespan regulation.'], prompt: Consider the given context and following statements, then determine whether they are supported by the information present in the context.

context: ['A supervised (pathway driven) approach was used to specifically query three general gene ontology (GO) areas of interest, namely xenobiotic metabolism, DNA damage repair, and oxidative stress-related genes (Table 1).These gene categories are hypothesized to play important roles in sex-and age-related susceptibility to adverse drug effects [18,30].Of the 122 genes included in the xenobiotic metabolism gene list in the Ingenuity Knowledge Base, 61 were differentially expressed.These included Cyp2d4, the rat ortholog of human gene CYP2D6, which is speculated to metabolize up to 25% of commonly prescribed drugs [31].Genes involved in DNA Damage Repair, derived from Ingenuity, were combined with the list by Wood et al. [32] to give 222 genes involved in DNA damage repair.Sixty-five of these genes (approximately 25%) were found to be differentially expressed in the liver.Oxidative Stress genes were defined by 68 genes included in "response to oxidative stress" (IPA) of which 23 genes were differentially expressed (Table 1).', "Pharmacogenomics has advanced the field of drug-response assessment.For example, the first experiences with guiding vitamin K antagonist therapy with the aid of CYP2C9 (cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily C, polypeptide 9) or VKORC1 (vitamin K epox- ide reductase complex, subunit 1) polymorphisms (93 ), and the use of cytochrome P450 polymorphisms for assessing clopidogrel response have entered US Food and Drug Administration recommendations (94 ).Disease prevention lags behind.Gene chips and modern sequencing approaches that allow largescale interrogation of the genome at the population level will generate novel hypotheses of disease causation.Furthermore, with the continuing drop in the costs of whole-genome sequencing, the practicing physician may soon be faced with having to comment on the disease risks of a patient's Ͼ4 ϫ 10 6 sequence variants before any clinical signs occur, a task that no certified genetic counselor could fulfill at present.With advent of GWASs, ethical and practical concerns of reporting genetic research results have become apparent.Initial efforts at defining rules of reporting large-scale association results and assessing the level of evidence also apply to nextgeneration large-scale genomics (95,96 ).Reports have suggested that on the consumer side, genomewide genetic profiling of employees of health and technology companies does not change anxiety symptoms, dietary fat intake, or exercise behavior (i.e., lifestyle factors) over a 6-month period (97 ); however, the association of genetic variation with risk and the dissection of objective markers of risk and risk factors that reside in the causal pathways of disease will need careful assessment before these approaches can enter clinical decision making (98 ).A data set containing 80 genes associated with coronary heart disease in GWASs was uploaded and overlaid onto the molecular networks developed from information contained in the Ingenuity Knowledge Base.Networks of Network Eligible Molecules were then algorithmically generated on the basis of their connectivity.The most substantially enriched network, as shown, comprises 36 genes, of which 20 are coronary heart disease genes.", '19.3.1 An environmental or pharmacogenetic basis for drug efficacy and ADR?

[17 •• ] concluded that the proteins produced from the newly discovered genes, ABCG5 and ABCG8, were responsible for the regulated reverse transport of newly absorbed cholesterol and phytosterols out of the apical surface of intestinal cells.Using public gene databases, a human homolog of the putative mouse transporter was identified, cloned and used to screen sitosterolemic humans.Dysfunctional mutations were found in these genes in all individuals suffering from sitosterolemia.Thus, individuals suffering from sitosterolemia lack the machinery responsible for the selective and controlled transport of cholesterol, and therefore hyperabsorb various sterols (including plant sterols).This study illustrated many of the strengths of genomic experimentation: the identification of phenotypically important genes using global differential gene expression analysis; querying internet databases to deduce structure/function relationships from sequence comparison; and the characterization of individual variation (polymorphism) linked to health.These findings have transformed our understanding of lipid absorption and metabolism, begging the question: how long would this knowledge have waited to be discovered without genomics?", '19.3.1 An environmental or pharmacogenetic basis for drug efficacy and ADR?

context: ['In one case, a gene identified by mutation recovered from a genetic screen in the laboratory, methuselah, may have variants in natural populations.In particular, the common ATATC haplotype has a sharp geographic (north-south) cline in U.S. populations, which, intriguingly, is associated with an 18% difference in life span (97).It would be interesting to examine these natural populations for differences in their reproductive schedule.Extensive studies show that life span can be rapidly selected as an indirect outcome of artificial selection for age at reproduction.Samples from natural populations of Drosophila contain genetic variants that can be rapidly selected, within 15 generations, for 50% or greater differences in life span on the basis of choosing individuals that are reproductive at early versus later ages (93).Selection was reversible, indicating that these life history variants depended on existing gene combinations not new mutations.Among the genes that differed in quantitative expression between young-and old-selected lines were heat shock proteins, e.g., hsp 22 (60).An overarching conclusion from fly aging genetics is that stress resistance is coupled to longevity (94), as in C. elegans.Other gene candidates are being sought by QTL analysis and show complex interactions with gender and population density (17,115).', 'Murabito JM, Yuan R, Lunetta KL (2012) The search for longevity and healthy aging genes: insights from epidemiological studies and samples of long-lived individuals.

additional mutations, DNA damage, and other forms of genome instability.For instance, the expression of several families of retrotransposable elements increases with age, as observed in mouse skeletal muscle and human fibroblasts, particularly the long interspersed nuclear element-1 (L1 LINE) [17,18].", 'The Height-Life Span Nexus  Several observations and lines of experimentation have raised the issue of whether interindividual differences in aging rate are influenced by genes that modulate body size and early-life growth patterns.These include (a) the association between small stature and exceptional longevity in calorically restricted rodents (Yu et al., 1985), methionine-restricted rats (Orentreich et al., 1993), and mutant dwarf mice (Brown-Borg et al., 1996;Miller, 1999); and (b) the association between small body size and longer life span in natural populations of mice (Falconer et al., 1978), flies (Hillesheim and Stearns, 1992), dogs (Li et al., 1996), and, possibly, people (Samaras andStorms, 1992).The correlation in dogs is particularly striking: selective breeding for dogs of different body size has produced breeds varying in size from Chihuahua to Irish wolfhound.These breeds also vary greatly in mean longevity, from approximately 7 to 10.5 years, and the correlation between breed longevity and breed body weight (Miller, 1999) is a remarkable R 2 = 0.56.These differences are genetic and affect stature rather than obesity: no amount of overeating will convert a West Highland white terrier to a St. Bernard.The selective pressures applied were designed to create dogs of specific sizes and temperaments and were not intended to influence aging rate or life span.The clear implication is that the effects on longevity are pleiotropic, i.e., that genes selected for their effect on body size and conformation influenced life span as a side effect.It is of interest to note that the few analyses (Eigenmann et al., 1984(Eigenmann et al., , 1988) ) of the hormonal basis for interbreed differences in body size have shown that the genes in question influence levels of IGF-1, the most likely mediator of the life-span effects in the long-lived df/df and dw/dw mouse mutants.Could it be mere coincidence that long-lived mutant nematode worms (Kimura et al., 1997) also show mutations in genes related to insulin and IGF-1 receptors?', 'The

data from model organisms and the few genes associated with human ageing (e.g.genes causing progeroid syndromes).', 'Genes/loci identified by genome-wide association studies of longevity and lifespan traits.', "ANALYSIS OF HUMAN VARIATION IN THE GENETIC CONTROL OF LONGEVITY  Heritability studies have convincingly demonstrated that at least some fraction of human lifespan is heritable.In tandem, large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous loci associated with age-related traits (Buniello et al., 2019).While genetic studies have functionally shown an inverse effect of multiple age-related, diseaseassociated variants on lifespan regulation, the number of well-replicated longevity-conferring variants remains limited to variants in APOE (ApoE ε2), and more recently, CDKN2A/B and IL6 (see Table 1).To date, studies in humans have been hampered by the specific phenotype definitions used, sample sizes of the extreme phenotypes, and modest heritability of the longevity-related traits (Breitbach et al., 2019).This is due to the complex interplay of biological and social factors involved in human aging, as well as the limited power of GWAS, which require sampling thousands of subjects to achieve statistical significance (Breitbach et al., 2019).Genetic studies of aging have also been hindered by an inconsistent use of definitions of aging (reviewed in Baghdadi et al., 2020).The two main ways of conducting research on the genetics of longevity in human populations are by studying (i) the lifespan (continuous trait, years lived) and (ii) the longevity (dichotomous trait, i.e., being among the longest-lived individuals within a specific population).These complexities have limited the resolution and capability of broad association studies of human longevity.Importantly, these genomic analyses focus on a shift of survival in a population; these variables may be genetically distinct from the mechanisms establishing potential for longevity overall (Figure 1A).We argue that an understanding of this shift in lifespan as well as genetic mechanisms of regulating a species specific 'set points' (Figure 1B) will aid in the conceptual distinction of aging and longevity in humans.", 'Put more simply: What is the strength of evidence in favor of GXE effects on lifespan? We ask if youthful adult body weight (~120 days) predicts lifespan. Is the change in body weight in adults in response to a HFD a causal predictor of lifespan?

Our focus is both on overall effects and on strain-specific difference in effect of diet on lifespan and weight gain, rather than on specific genetic modifiers or loci of lifespan.', "Studies in various models have revealed that genetic differences and somatic mutations underlie longevity, but non-genetic contributions also play a major role (Cournil and Kirkwood, 2001).Calorie restriction (Bordone and Guarente, 2005), lowering of basal metabolic rate (Ruggiero et al., 2008), upregulated stress response (Migliaccio et al., 1999), restoration of mi-tonuclear protein balance (Houtkooper et al., 2013), and reduced fertility (Westendorp and Kirkwood, 1998) have all been shown to correlate with lifespan extension.These observations illuminate the role of ''epi''-genetic mechanisms in modulating longevity pathways.", "Introduction  Approximately 25-30% of the variation in adult lifespan is attributable to genetic factors that become more important with increasing age and exert their strongest effects in nonagenarians and centenarians (Go ¨gele et al., 2010;Hjelmborg et al., 2006).As yet, however, only a few genetic variants have been found consistently to influence longevity.The first to be discovered was the e4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene, a mortality factor that predisposes to both Alzheimer's and cardiovascular diseases (Corder et al., 1993; Panza et al., 2004).APOE e4 is the only variant with a reportedly large adverse effect upon survival at advanced age (Scha ¨chter et al., 1994), and this association has been replicated in several populations (Christensen et al., 2006).Variation in the human forkhead box O3A gene (FOXO3A), in contrast, has been found to be associated with the ability to live long, an effect corroborated by studies in Japanese, German, Italian, US-American, Jewish, Chinese and Danish populations (Anselmi et al., 2009;Flachsbart et al., 2009;Li et al., 2009;Pawlikowska et al., 2009;Soerensen et al., 2010;Willcox et al., 2008).More recently, we have identified exonuclease 1 (EXO1) as a potential novel longevity gene (Nebel et al., 2009).All three genes were detected through candidate-gene approaches.", 'Studies of mono-and dizygous twins have revealed that the genetic contribution to the variation in human lifespan is about 25-30% [12,13], and is most prominent in families clustered for longevity [14,15].This genetic contribution is mainly apparent after the age of 60 years and seems to increase with age [13,16].Furthermore, human lifespan is a complex trait which is assumed to be determined by many genes with small individual effects [17], although the polygenic architecture still needs to be characterized [18,19].The diverse health features of long-lived families illustrate that different age-related diseases have common determinants and implicate that pathways can be identified that attenuate aging and delay age-related disease.From a genomic perspective, individuals from long-lived families are assumed to be characterized by a decreased prevalence of disease-promoting variants (referred to as disease-susceptibility alleles) and an increased prevalence of variants conferring maintenance of health and protection from disease, when compared to population controls.In the last 5 years, many diseasesusceptibility alleles have been identified (National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) genome-wide association study (GWAS) Catalog; http://www.genome.gov/gwastudies/)[20].A first comparison between long-lived individuals, selected from both long-lived families (LLS) and the general population (Leiden 85-plus study), and young controls showed no difference in the distribution or frequency of disease-susceptibility alleles identified in cancer, coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes [21].The search for lifespan regulating loci -contributing to longevity and population mortality -must therefore extend beyond a focus on disease-susceptibility alleles.We will first discuss the efforts to identify longevity loci by genetics approaches.'], prompt: Consider the given context and following statements, then determine whether they are supported by the information present in the context.

context: ['One surprising result of our experiment was the relatively weak support for involvement of the insulin/insulin-like signaling (IIS) or target-of-rapamycin (TOR) pathways in the evolution of late-life performance.Mutations in genes within these pathways can alter life span and fertility in flies and other organisms (Partridge and Gems 2002); natural genetic variation in expression of IIS/TOR-pathway genes has been reported to predict agingrelated phenotypes (Nuzhdin et al. 2009), and natural clinal variation in the insulin receptor gene InR has been associated with variation in stress resistance and fecundity (Paaby et al. 2010).We therefore expected that some of these genes would contribute to the evolution of life span and late-life fecundity in our experiment.Only one gene previously annotated with the Gene Ontology biological function "determination of adult life span" (Cct1) was among the genes bearing the strongest signature of selection, no more than would be expected by chance (1/96 of the candidate genes that had some biological process annotation, compared to 116/10,792 of all genes with some biological-process annotation, χ [1] 2 = 0.002, P > 0.96).Genes annotated with the functions "aging" or "determination of adult life span" were also significantly underrepresented among differentially expressed genes (43/215 transcripts with these annotations had P < 0.05 for line or line-by-age effects, compared to 4488/13,258 of all annotated transcripts, χ [1] 2 = 18.1, P < 0.0001).Most of the genes we identified are therefore novel candidates for the regulation of life span and late-age performance.', 'Rapamycin  Rapamycin has been shown to robustly increase lifespan in at least three different mouse strains and to improve healthspan measures including cognitive function, cardiac function, immune function, obesity, and cancer incidence (Johnson et al. 2015;Kaeberlein 2014).', 'mTOR activates the kinase S6K, which phosphorylates S6, inhibiting autophagy [92].Rapamycin can extend the life span of organisms from yeast to mammals in a dose-dependent manner [95].However, some data suggest that rapamycin has unwanted metabolic effects, including insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, glucose intolerance, and hypophosphatemia;

for example, Ames dwarf mice live more than 50% longer than their wild-type siblings [1].These diminutive mice result from a point mutation in a gene (Prop1 df/df ) that drives development of the pituitary gland, so that mutant mice are deficient in specific hormones.The GH deficiency, in particular, has been shown to underlie their enhanced health span and extended lifespan.Ames mice are highly insulinsensitive, resistant to some stresses and the incidence of cancer is delayed [2][3][4].Dietary and drug interventions that extend lifespan include calorie restriction (CR) and the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin [5].Like the Ames dwarf mutation, CR and rapamycin also suppress and/ or delay the incidence of cancer [5][6][7].A detailed understanding of how these interventions exert their beneficial effects is essential to develop strategies to promote healthy aging in humans [8].Currently, these interventions are thought to exert their effects by related and interconnected effects on some or all of the following: genome stability, the epigenome, telomere attrition and/or function, protein quality control, mitochondrial function, nutrient sensing, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, cellular stress responses and altered intercellular communication [9].Of note, the effects of longevity promoting interventions on the epigenome, a key determinant of cell phenotype, are poorly understood.', "The target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathway has also emerged as a major regulator of lifespan.TOR is a highly conserved kinase that transduces signals from nutrients to regulate cell size, cell growth, and metabolism (Martin & Hall, 2005).Genetic studies in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have shown that reduced levels of nutrients, namely amino acids and sugars, can extend yeast lifespan through regulation of the TOR signaling pathway (Kaeberlein et al ., 2005;Powers et al ., 2006).In Drosophila , recent studies have shown that amino acid restriction, rather than 'calorie restriction', extends lifespan (Min & Tatar, 2006).In C. elegans , either inactivation of CeTOR/let-363 by RNAi, or mutations in Raptor/daf-15 , encoding a regulatory subunit of CeTOR, leads to lifespan extension (Vellai et al ., 2003;Jia et al ., 2004).", 'As mentioned above, a number of genes regulating longevity also control growth and development.Some of these, such as the insulin/IGF1/GH pathway, have been suggested to play a role in the mechanisms of CR (Fig. 1).An emerging critical player is the target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathway, which involves both nutrient sensing and regulation of growth.Several genes in the TOR pathway, and the TOR gene itself, regulate longevity in flies (Kapahi et al., 2004) and both longevity and dauer diapause in worms (Jia et al., 2004).Strikingly, not only have genetic manipulations of the TOR gene extended lifespan in yeast and worms (Stanfel et al., 2009) but also feeding rapamycin (which inhibits TOR and is also known as sirolimus) to middle-aged mice significantly (9 -14%) increased lifespan (Harrison et al., 2009).Whether rapamycin is extending lifespan by delaying of aging or by affecting a specific disease, such as cancer, remains unclear.More recent studies show that starting rapamycin administration earlier in life does AGING GENES AS TARGETS FOR DRUG DISCOVERY not result in a significantly greater increase in lifespan (10 -18%) than that obtained in middle-aged mice (Miller et al., 2011).', 'Replacement of the C/ebpα gene with C/ebpβ increases lifespan by 20% [35,36], and may alter the rate of aging [37], indicating that altering the isoform expression of these genes can affect lifespan.Moreover, the life-extending drug rapamycin may affect isoform ratios of C/ebpβ.Rapamycin has been shown to increase lifespan via the suppression of Mtor [38] which in turn controls the isoform ratios of C/ebpβ [39].Therefore, we speculate that rapamycin may in part exert its life extending effect through C/ebpβ.', 'The genome-wide RNAi study conducted by the Ruvkun lab, authored by Hamilton et al. [88], identified a total of 89 additional aging genes with disparate functions including cell structure, cell surface proteins, cell signaling, cellular metabolism, and protein turnover.Of the 66 genes with previously known functions, 17 corresponded to various aspects of carbon metabolism, including citric acid cycle enzymes and subunits of complexes I, IV, and V of the ETC.Researchers also speculated that protein translation might play a role in lifespan regulation, based on the identification of iff-1 (T05G5.10),a gene that has homology to the translation initiation factor eIF5A.Other hits from this screen included two genes containing PH domains known to interact with phosphatidylinositol lipids, multiple G protein-coupled receptors, protein processing and degradation genes such as proteases and ubiquitin ligases/hydrolases, and chromatin modifying factors.', 'How cellular processes that regulate aging impact genome stability also remain unclear.Compelling evidence now exists that in all eukaryotes, aging is regulated by conserved insulin/insulin-like growth factor (I-(IFG-1)) pathways and growth-signaling pathways regulated by the target of rapamycin (TOR) family of kinases (4).In general, experimental manipulations that upregulate these pathways promote aging, and manipulations that downregulate these pathways-including mutational inactivation or caloric restriction-extend life span and mitigate age-related pathologies.Downregulation of these pathways often leads to a reduction in oxidative stress and oxidative damage to DNA and other cellular constituents.For the most part, however, the relationship between aging and changes in oxidative damage downstream of alterations in growth-signaling pathways remains correlative rather than causal.', 'The potential of interventional approaches targeted at aging has yet to be realized in part because aging is a complicated multisystem process that has remained enigmatic.However, research over the last two decades has led to significant excitement.One of the most striking findings is that it is possible to administer a clinically approved drug, rapamycin, to mice at 20 months of age and extend both their life span and health span (Harrison et al., 2009).Surprisingly, much of the recent success of aging research can be traced back to one of its simplest model organisms: yeast.Two of the major pathways studied in the context of aging and age-related disease are the sirtuin pathway and the TOR signaling pathway, and yeast was pivotal in their discovery.'], prompt: Consider the given context and following statements, then determine whether they are supported by the information present in the context.

context: ['We briefly comment on rare mutations that shorten life span through the early onset of diseases that are increasingly common during aging in the general population, e.g., familial forms of Alzheimer, breast cancer, coronary artery disease, type II diabetes, etc.The later onset forms of these diseases are associated with causes of death at later ages.A major question is what role the more common allelic variants of these same genes have in "normal aging".Although examination of this huge emerging topic goes beyond the present discussion, we may consider the example of Werner\'s syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive that causes adult onset progeria with a high incidence of cancer and atherosclerosis (70).The absence of Alzheimer-type dementia in Werner\'s syndrome illustrates the "segmental" nature of this and other progerias (70).Thus, heritable shortening of life span should not be considered as a simple acceleration of general aging processes.The Werner\'s lesion maps to a defective gene encoding a helicase and exonuclease, which also has several polymorphisms.In Japan, 1367Arg was associated with a lower risk of myocardial infarction (70), although it was not associated with longevity in Finland (14).In general, we know little of the genetic factors involved in frailty and morbidity at later ages, which are important to the geneenvironment interactions implied in the major longevity increase seen during the twentieth century.', 'Indicative diseases associated with the candidate aging genes', "D  ementia has an age-and sex-standardized prevalence of ~7.1% in Europeans 1 , with Alzheimer's disease (AD) being the most common form of dementia (50-70% of cases) 2 .AD is pathologically characterized by the presence of amyloid-beta plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles in the brain 3 .Most patients are diagnosed with AD after the age of 65, termed late-onset AD (LOAD), while only 1% of AD cases have an early onset (before the age of 65) 3 .On the basis of twin studies, the heritability of LOAD is estimated to be ~60-80% (refs. 4,5 ), suggesting that a large proportion of individual differences in LOAD risk is driven by genetics.The heritability of LOAD is spread across many genetic variants;

additional genetic polymorphisms have been identified, though with substantially lower risk estimates [1,4,5,6,7,8,9,10].LOAD appears to be inherited and/or sporadic and there is evidence of a maternal inheritance pattern [11].Current estimates suggest that more than 20% of inherited LOAD cases are maternally inherited [12].", "INTRODUCTION  Many common noninfectious diseases exhibit a more severe clinical presentation in older individuals.These diseases often exhibit complex etiology and can affect different tissues and cell types, with a wide spectrum of clinical outcomes.Prominent aging-associated neurodegenerative diseases are Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and age-related macular degeneration (AMD), all of which can severely compromise the quality of life and have serious repercussions on both the individual and society at large.These late-onset diseases generally result from the interplay between multiple genetic susceptibility factors and environmental components.Sequencing of the human genome, cataloging of millions of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) together with the development of a map of common haplotypes, and technological innovations in genotyping are among the major milestones that are facilitating exploration of the genetic basis of common diseases (1,7,50).In the field of AMD genetics, these advances have led to the identification of several genetic susceptibility factors and enabled us to start dissecting the relationship between environmental risk factors and the genetic constitution of each individual

first-degree relatives), and used linkage analysis of highly polymorphic genetic markers called short tandem repeats (STRs, or microsattelites) in order to identify genomic regions co-transmitting with disease in affected family members.This strategy, followed by "fine mapping"-the positional cloning of candidate genes-was used to identify genes and genetic variants contributing to AD risk.The first three genes known to cause AD were identified among families with multiple early-onset cases (age-at-onset <60 years): APP, encoding amyloid precursor protein [Goate et al., 1991], and PS1 and PS2, encoding presenilins I and II respectively [Levy-Lahad et al., 1995;Rogaev et al., 1995;Sherrington et al., 1995], each transmitting disease-causing variants in the predicted autosomal-dominant

sequencing studies to develop statistically well-powered and comprehensive genomic studies of AD.Through this review, we help uncover the many insights the genetics of AD have provided into the pathways and pathophysiology of AD.", 'Indeed, as age increases, there is an exponential increase in the incidence of AD, with a corresponding effect on healthcare costs and quality of life. AD is a complex disease involving several genetic and environmental components (Hardy, 1997; Munoz & Feldman, 2000), and 15% of patients have a genetic predisposition. Almost 100 candidate genes are currently known to be involved in the development of AD, and only 4 (APP, PSEN1, PSEN2, APOE) in humans have been proven to play a direct role in AD pathogenesis (Thomas & Fenech, 2007).', 'T  he genetics of Alzheimer disease (AD) to date support an age-dependent dichotomous model whereby earlier age of disease onset (Ͻ60 years) is explained by 3 fully penetrant genes (APP [NCBI Entrez gene 351], PSEN1 [NCBI Entrez gene 5663], and PSEN2 [NCBI Entrez gene 5664]), whereas later age of disease onset (Ն65 years) representing most cases of AD has yet to be explained by a purely genetic model.The APOE gene (NCBI Entrez gene 348) is the strongest genetic risk factor for later onset, although it is neither sufficient nor necessary to explain all occurrences of disease.Numerous putative genetic risk alleles and genetic variants have been reported.Although all have relevance to biological mechanisms that may be associated with AD pathogenesis, they await replication in large representative populations.Genome-wide association studies have emerged as an increasingly effective tool for identifying genetic contributions to complex diseases and represent the next frontier for furthering our understanding of the underlying etiologic, biological, and pathologic mechanisms associated with chronic complex disorders.There have already been success stories for diseases such as macular degeneration and diabetes mellitus.Whether this will hold true for a genetically complex and heterogeneous disease such as AD is not known, although early reports are encouraging.This review considers recent publications from studies that have successfully applied genome-wide association methods to investigations of AD by taking advantage of the currently available high-throughput arrays, bioinformatics, and software advances.The inherent strengths, limitations, and challenges associated with study design issues in the context of AD are presented herein.', 'Arch Neurol.2008;65(3): 329-334   Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder associated with aging. 1 Alzheimer disease is a heterogeneous disorder with a complex etiology owing to genetic and environmental influences as causal or risk modifiers.The neuropathologic hallmarks of disease are extracellular amyloid plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. 2 Only 10% of AD cases occurring before 60 years of age (early-onset AD) are due to rare, fully penetrant (autosomal dominant) mutations in 3 genes: A␤ precursor protein (APP) on chromosome 21, 3 presenilin 1 (PSEN1) on chromosome 14, 4 and presenilin 2 (PSEN2) on chromosome 1. 5,6In contrast, most cases of AD are later in onset (Ն 65 years of age) (late-onset AD), are nonfamilial, and are likely the result of highly prevalent genetic variants with low penetrance. 7To date, the only genetic risk factor for lateonset AD remains the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE), specifically the ε4 allele, which is moderately penetrant, accounting for up to 50% of cases. 8owever, a robust literature reports numerous putative genetic risk alleles and promising genetic variants.Recent reports from individual studies reveal significant associations with the sortilin-related receptor (SORL1 [NCBI Entrez gene 6653]) 9,10 and glycine-rich protein 2-associated binding protein 2 (GAB2 [NCBI Entrez gene 9846]) 11 on chromosome 11; death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1 [NCBI Entrez gene 1612]), 12 ubiquilin 1 (UBQLN1 [NCBI Entrez gene 299798]), 13 and adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter 1, subfamily A (ABCA1 [NCBI Entrez gene 19]), on chromosome 9 14 ; and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6 [NCBI Entrez gene 4040]) on chromosome 12. 15 All of these putative variants still lack replication in large representative populations but have relevance to neuropathologic mechanisms and pathways that may be associated with AD pathogenesis (   A large meta-analysis from the AlzGene database 16 17 All are associated with relevant biological mechanisms and pathways but await replication to further elucidate their utility as significant markers for AD.', "Background  Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder and the leading cause of dementia in the elderly [1].Diagnosis of AD is based on the presence of neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques [2], and symptoms typically include memory loss and impaired cognitive ability.Although the pathological hallmarks associated with dementia-related symptoms in AD appear largely similar between both the early-onset and late-onset forms of the disease, their underlying etiologies contrast [3].Whereas early-onset AD is a familial autosomal dominant disorder caused by rare, highly penetrant mutations in one of a small set of genes (APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2), the more common late-onset form of the disease (accounting for 90-95 % of cases) occurs sporadically, and risk is determined by complex underlying mechanisms [3][4][5][6].Estimates based on twin concordance rates suggest heritability of late-onset AD is as high as 70 %, implicating major roles for genetic as well as non-genetic factors [6].Indeed, through candidate gene studies, as well as more recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and whole-exome sequencing, both common and rare variants associated with the late-onset form of AD have been identified [7][8][9][10][11].Collectively, however, common GWAS variants account for only a modest proportion (~30 %) of the underlying variance in disease susceptibility [12].Several environmental factors are also thought to play a role [5,6], yet exactly how these contribute to risk, onset, and progression remains poorly defined.", "Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia, and it is characterized by a decline in memory or other thinking skills.The greatest risk factor for Alzheimer's disease is advanced age.A recent genome-wide study identified a locus on chromosome 17 associated with the age at onset, and a specific variant in CCL11 is probably responsible for the association.The association of a protective haplotype with a 10-year delay in the onset of Alzheimer's disease and the identification of a CCL11 variant with possible functional roles in this association might allow the future development of immunomodulators with the potential to halve disease incidence.", "Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia, and it is characterized by a decline in memory or other thinking skills.The greatest risk factor for Alzheimer's disease is advanced age.A recent genome-wide study identified a locus on chromosome 17 associated with the age at onset, and a specific variant in CCL11 is probably responsible for the association.The association of a protective haplotype with a 10-year delay in the onset of Alzheimer's disease and the identification of a CCL11 variant with possible functional roles in this association might allow the future development of immunomodulators with the potential to halve disease incidence.", "INTRODUCTION  Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common debilitating disorder with a prevalence that rises steeply with age from below 1% at 65 years to as high as 40% after the age of 90 [Bachman et al., 1992].Genes are known to play a role in the development of AD.Twin studies show heritabilities of around 60% [Bergem et al., 1997;Gatz et al., 1997].Indeed, variation in four genes has already been shown to cause rare forms of early-onset AD [the Amyloid Precursor Protein Gene (APP); Goate et al., 1991; Presenilin 1 (PS1); Sherrington et al., 1995; Presenilin 2 (PS2); Levy Lahad et al., 1995, Rogaev et al., 1995] or increase the general risk of disease development [Apolipoprotein E (APOE), Corder et al., 1993].As well as increasing disease susceptibility, APOE e4 alleles are associated with reduced age at onset (AAO) and appear to show their strongest effect below 70 years [Farrer et al., 1997].There is also evidence from both twin [Pedersen et al., 2001] and family studies [Tunstall et al., 2000;Li et al., 2002] that AAO in AD is heritable.Daw et al. [2000] have estimated that in addition to APOE, there are at least four loci with similar effect sizes, which contribute to AAO in AD.", "Introduction  Alzheimer's disease (AD), a devastating neurodegenerative disease, is the most common form of dementia among the elderly.Genetically, AD is a complex and multifactorial disease with the possible involvement of multiple genes.The rare early-onset form of the disease usually follows an autosomal-dominant inheritance pattern and to date three genes have been identified: amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin 1 and 2 (PSEN1 and PSEN2).The common late-onset form of the disease is much more complex than the early-onset form and until recently the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene was the only major genetic factor accounting for 20-29% of the risk for late-onset AD. 1,2 Recent large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identi-fied nine additional genes for late-onset AD, including CR1, BIN1, CLU (a.k.a.4][5][6][7] There is high heritability for AD risk (up to 80%), 8 but the total risk attributable to all confirmed loci is about 50%, indicating the presence of additional risk genes for late-onset AD.", 'NE OF EVERY 5 PERSONS AGED 65 years is predicted to develop Alzheimer disease (AD) in their lifetime, and genetic variants may play an important part in the development of the disease. 1 The apparent substantial heritability of late-onset AD 2 is inadequately explained by genetic variation within the well-replicated genes (apolipoprotein E [APOE; RefSeq NG_007084], presenilin-1 [PSEN1; RefSeq NG_007386], presenilin-2 [PSEN2; RefSeq NG_007381], and amyloid beta precursor protein [APP;'], prompt: Consider the given context and following statements, then determine whether they are supported by the information present in the context.
