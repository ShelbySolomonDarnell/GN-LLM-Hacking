    "Targeting the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway has potential therapeutic benefits for extending healthspan and lifespan. Reduced circulating insulin can enhance insulin sensitivity and extend lifespan, as seen in mice. Drugs that reduce GH secretion or block its action may have metabolic benefits in patients with T2D and damaging missense variants in the protein kinase domain of IGF1R. However, the challenges include understanding the complex relationship between GH and IGF-1, the potential for insulin resistance due to uncontrolled lipolytic effects of GH, and the need to distinguish between cell autonomous versus non-cell autonomous effects. Additionally, the linkage between insulin levels, resistance, and lifespan appears to be complex and modest, indicating a need for further research.",
    "The integration of proteomics and metabolomics data can provide insights into age-associated metabolic shifts by allowing researchers to observe changes in protein and metabolite concentrations over time. This can help identify age-related changes in metabolic profiles, providing new insights into the physiological mechanisms of ageing. Additionally, the integration of these data sets can help in understanding the complex processes linking immunity, ageing, and lifespan evolution. It can also aid in identifying potential biomarkers for ageing and age-related diseases.",
    "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a crucial role in the regulation of aging and age-related diseases by influencing transcriptional networks, chromatin states, and gene expression. They are involved in various biological regulatory functions such as cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and senescence. They have been associated with diseases like Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, atherosclerosis, and cancer. They also play a role in cellular processes like cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Some specific lncRNAs, like MIR31HG, Meg3, and H19, have been identified as being regulated during aging and in age-related diseases. The use of techniques like CRISPR-Cas9 is helping to further understand the functions of lncRNA in the aging process.",
    "Recent advancements in CRISPR/Cas9 technology allow for precise and efficient genome editing, which opens new avenues for studying and potentially reversing aging. This technology can be used to probe genetic and epigenetic pathways related to aging with a level of sophistication previously unattainable. It can also accelerate the generation of refined models for studying aging and age-related diseases. Furthermore, CRISPR/Cas9 can be used to identify causative genes for age-related diseases, opening the way for personalized medicine. It has also been used to study the role of telomeres in aging and to investigate the mechanisms of longevity. Additionally, it has contributed significantly to studies addressing the molecular pathogenesis of age-related neurodegenerative conditions.",
    "The DNA damage response (DDR) is significant in both replicative and chronological aging as it mediates repair and cellular arrest or apoptosis in response to DNA damage. Persistent DNA damage due to defects in DDR can lead to genomic instability, cellular senescence, and apoptosis, all of which contribute to aging. DDR also impacts various cellular processes such as transcription, DNA repair, respiration, energy metabolism, and chromatin remodeling. In the context of aging, persistent DDR signaling due to difficult-to-repair DNA lesions can induce specific gene expression changes that are detectable in aged tissues. Therefore, DDR plays a crucial role in the aging process."

      "\t\n\nA key finding of our work is the association between IGF1R and T2D risk.3][34] Our findings of rare damaging variants at IGF1R, and also at IGFALS and IGFBP3, indicate that reduced IGF-1 bioactivity and signaling increases risk for T2D.There are several plausible mechanisms to link IGF1R to T2D.IGF1R, responding to both systemic and locally generated IGF-1, plays a role in the development of several tissues central to the control of glucose metabolism including pancreatic islets, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle. 35An alternative explanation involves the complex relationship between GH and IGF-1.GH, produced in a highly controlled and pulsatile manner from the somatotropes of the anterior pituitary, is the major stimulus to the hepatic expression and secretion of IGF-1, the major source of this circulating hormone.GH also has metabolic effects that are independent of IGF-1, largely exerted by its powerful lipolytic effects in adipose tissue, [36][37][38][39][40][41] which, if uncontrolled, can lead to the accumulation of ectopic lipid in non-adipose tissue, resulting in insulin resistance.This is elegantly demonstrated by studies in mice in which IGF-1 is selectively deleted in the liver. 42,43hese mice show a striking increase in circulating GH levels accompanied by marked insulin resistance, which is entirely abrogated by the blockade of GH signaling.This model can explain the insulin resistance and frequent T2D seen in conditions such as acromegaly, where GH levels are persistently raised due to a functional somatotrope tumor, 44 and the striking protection from T2D seen in patients with Laron dwarfism, whose markedly reduced circulating IGF-1 levels are due to biallelic loss-of-function (LoF) mutations in the GH receptor. 45oF mutations in IGF1R are likely to result in compensatory increases in GH secretion and, consequently, the higher levels of circulating IGF-1 that we observed in the carriers of such mutations.While this may partially compensate for impairment in IGF1R function, the lipolytic effects of GH are likely to have a deleterious effect on systemic glucose metabolism.Of note in this regard, a single human proband with a homozygous LoF mutation in IGF1 had elevated circulating GH and severe insulin resistance. 46,47Therapy with exogenous IGF-1 resulted in sup-pression of GH and a dose-dependent improvement in insulin sensitivity. 47Accordingly, genetic variants that primarily reduce GH secretion and signaling would lead to reduced IGF-1 bioactivity but without the consequent effects of elevated GH on fatty acid metabolism and insulin resistance and, hence, no alteration in T2D risk.We propose that currently available drugs that reduce GH secretion or block its action may have metabolic benefits in patients with T2D and damaging missense variants in the protein kinase domain of IGF1R.",
      "\t\n\nThe framework described in this paper is aimed to address two key questions: (1) Can biological processes be identified that are consistently deregulated in different models of insulin resistance and diabetes and that may be manifested in a tissue-dependent or independent manner? (2) On a higher level, can tissue or condition-specific interaction networks be identified that more precisely characterize different insulinresistance models and suggest causal mechanisms?\t\n\nWe began the investigation by focusing on insulin-signaling genes, a natural and well-established candidate for finding a signature set of genes associated with insulin resistance or diabetes [9].In particular, by examining microarray data, we attempted to detect a statistically significant, transcriptional alteration in a set of insulin-signaling genes in diabetic tissue compared to normal.Surprisingly, using existing analytical methods, we were unable to detect such alterations in microarray data produced in several human studies.Using sophisticated and remarkably sensitive techniques, previous studies identified the oxidative phosphorylation pathway as transcriptionally down-regulated in diabetic muscle tissue compared to normal [10,11].However, insulin-signaling gene sets were not detected to be transcriptionally altered, using state of the art analyses, more than expected by chance.",
      "\tConclusions\n\nUnderstanding the molecular basis of impaired insulin action in type 2 diabetes is a challenging problem.Recent cell biology biochemical studies have yielded considerable insights into the molecular mechanisms of insulin action and their role in the pathophysiology of diabetes.The cloning of the two functionally distinct insulin receptor isoforms and the identification of hybrid receptors composed of an insulin receptor ab-hemireceptor and a type 1 IGF receptor ab-hemireceptor have provided significant information on the mechanism by which heterogeneity in insulin receptor binding can modulate metabolic and mitogenic signaling in target tissues in both physiological and pathological states.Thus, functional studies on the role of the two insulin receptor isoforms have led to the suggestion that insulin receptor mRNA alternative splicing represents a regulatory mechanism for modulation of insulin sensitivity in target tissues, and that alterations in the relative abundance of the two isoforms, especially in skeletal muscle and fat, might contribute to the development of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes.The pathophysiological role of hybrid receptors is still unclear.Because hybrid receptors display functional properties similar to those of type 1 IGF receptors, it is a plausible hypothesis that in insulin-resistant states such as type 2 diabetes, an increased proportion of hybrid receptors in target tissues of insulin action might affect insulin binding and thereby insulin sensitivity by sequestering insulin receptors in a less insulin-responsive form.Furthermore, it is possible that in human tissues hybrid receptors may be primarily responsive to mitogenic effects of IGF-I rather than metabolic effects of insulin.Thus, the upregulation of hybrid receptors in tissues such as vascular smooth muscle cells may increase the sensitivity to the mitogenic effects of IGF-I, thus contributing to diabetic vascular complications.Alternatively, the upregulation of hybrid receptors induced by hormonal and metabolic factors may be adaptive, perhaps protecting tissues from excessive insulin-induced glucose entry.In this respect, it is an intriguing hypothesis that insulin/IGF-I hybrid receptors may provide a mechanism whereby IGF-I utilizes insulin signaling pathways for eliciting metabolic effects.Since elegant studies of kinase-deficient insulin receptor mutants have shown that trans-phosphorylation is the major mechanism of intramolecular autophosphorylation [42], it is possible to speculate that IGF-I binding to hybrid receptors may activate the adjacent insulin receptor b-subunit or cellular substrates specifically associated with the insulin receptor b-subunit thus exerting more pronounced metabolic effects in addition to typical growth-promoting effects.Recombinant human IGF-I (rhIGF-I) has been proposed as a potential therapy for type 2 diabetes.Preliminary studies have shown that treatment with rhIGF-I increases insulin sensitivity and improves glycemic control in type 2 diabetic patients [76,77].The mechanisms by which rhIGF-I exerts these effects in vivo are unclear as IGF-I can act through type 1 IGF receptors, insulin receptors, or both.The observations of increased abundance of hybrids in skeletal muscle of type 2 diabetic subjects have raised the intriguing possibility that IGF-I might stimulate glucose transport and glycogen synthesis in muscle through insulin/IGF-I hybrid receptors.Therefore, increased expression of hybrid receptors could contribute to an increase in rhIGF-I sensitivity in type 2 diabetic patients.The clinical relevance of differences in both the low-affinity Ex11 + form and insulin/IGF-I hybrid receptors is at present unclear.Reduction by 20-30% of insulin binding is unlikely to cause the marked insulin resistance observed in patients with type 2 diabetes by itself because of the presence of spare receptors.Nevertheless, it is possible that defects in insulin binding, even if minor, may be additive to genetic or acquired defects in intracellular signaling thus contributing to the resistance to insulin action.Type 2 diabetes is the leading cause of renal failure, blindness, and lower limb amputations in adult individuals and is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases.Genetic predisposition is a primary determinant for development of type 2 diabetes in the urbanized Western world.Therefore, identification of the genetic defects resulting in the susceptibility to acquire type 2 diabetes is currently a major challenge for diabetes research.Several mutations in the insulin receptor gene have been described in genetic syndromes of severe insulin resistance.However, these are clinically and pathogenetically distinct from type 2 diabetes.Mutations in the insulin receptor gene have been identified in every study that examined an appropriately sized patient population of type 2 diabetic subjects.In these studies, the prevalence of mutations in the insulin receptor gene ranged from 0.4% to 7.8%.However, in most studies, only 20-30% of the protein coding sequence of the insulin receptor gene was investigated.Furthermore, the molecular scanning strategies were designed in a way that would only identify certain types of mutations, but would fail to identify deletions, mutations in the promoter or in other regulatory domains of the insulin receptor gene.In as much as 70-80% of the gene was not investigated, the true prevalence of mutations in the insulin receptor in common forms of type 2 diabetes could be as high as 5% [3].",
      "\tThree critical questions are to what extent are\nthese pathways redundant versus complementary, which pathways are altered in\ninsulin resistant states such as diabetes, and by what mechanisms are these\npathways altered. By knocking-out and knocking-down specific components of\nthe signaling systems in cells and tissues of intact animals, and comparing these\nknockouts/knockdowns to other insulin resistant or diabetic states, we have\nattempted to define the specific pathways that lead to each insulin action and\ndetermine how they are modified in disease states.\tIn global insulin resistance, such as\nobserved in the liver-specific insulin receptor knockout (LIRKO) mouse, there is\na resistance in both of these pathways leading to hyperglycemia and\ndyslipidemia, which in the presence of high fat diet can lead to accelerated\natherosclerosis. LIRKO mice are also predisposed towards cholesterol gallstone\nformation, and this involves and interaction between insulin signaling via\nFOXO1 and altered signaling through FXR created by the insulin resistant state. Insulin signaling in adipose tissue also interacts with developmental genes, such\nas Hox genes, and nuclear receptor signaling in control of adipose patterning\nand creation of insulin resistance.\tIn addition, we have\ndetermined the effects of these modifications on the pattern of gene expression\nin each tissue, and how insulin signaling might interact with nuclear receptor\nsignaling in insulin resistance. Tissues of particular importance in development\nof type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome include the liver, brain and fat.

      "\t\n\nFinally, the literature also reports that several signaling pathways, such as insulin/IGF1 (IIS), JNK, and AMPK, modulate mitochondrial metabolism, and probably the disruption of these pathways also compromised mitochondrial function, as occurs in insulin-resistant patients [112].",
      "\tSyndromes of insulin resistance\n\nSyndromes due to defects in the insulin signaling pathway as well as lipoatrophic diabetes could be modeled using hiPSC and genome editing technologies.hiPSCs from patients with defective insulin signaling molecules such as INSR [65], v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 2 (AKT2) and TBC1 domain family member 4 (TBC1D4) could be differentiated into skeletal myocytes, adipocytes, hepatic and pancreatic cell types to study abnormalities in development [66] (Figure 2) and to distinguish cell autonomous versus non-cell autonomous effects.Outstanding questions that could be addressed Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) derived from patients with monogenic diabetes, syndromes of insulin resistance, type 1 diabetes (T1D), type 2 diabetes (T2D) and metabolic syndromes can be differentiated into pancreatic cells, skeletal myocyotes, hepatic cells, adipocytes and immune cells, where relevant, to study disease mechanisms in vitro.2).Monogenic forms of insulin resistance that result into lipoatrophic diabetes can be subclassified into congenital generalized lipodystrophy (CGL) and familial partial lipodystrophy (FPL) [67] (Table 1).In the former, gene mutations typically affect various aspects of adipocyte biology such as the biosynthesis of triglycerides [68] or adipocyte differentiation [69], and hiPSCs from these patients could be a source for investigating the role of the mutated genes in adipocyte biology, lipoatrophic diabetes and insulin resistance.Considering the significant genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity in FPL, hiPSCs with LMNA and PPARG mutations can be used to study dysfunction in fat metabolism whereas cells with CIDEC and PLIN1 mutations can be used to study triglyceride mobilization and lipid droplet dynamics.",

      "\t\n\n1.The insulin-signaling chain: alterations found in insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.Figure 3 shows a simplified draft of the signaling steps from insulin receptor binding to glucose transport activation.Insulin signaling at the cellular level is mediated by binding of insulin to a specific receptor.Insulin binding to the receptor stimulates autophosphorylation of the intracellular region of the receptor -subunit (53).A reduced autoactivation status of the insulin receptor from skeletal muscle and adipocytes of type 2 diabetic patients has been described by several but not all investigators (54 -62).Some of these studies have shown that obesity was a major contributory factor for the development of a reduced insulin receptor activity (56,63).This could suggest that the defective insulin receptor kinase activity is secondarily acquired due to obesity and metabolic changes such as hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia.a. Insulin receptor substrates.The first substrate of the insulin receptor was described by White et al. in 1985 (64).Subsequently, this intracellular protein was cloned by Sun et al. (65) and named insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1).IRS-1 and other recently cloned IRS proteins (IRS-2, -3, -4) are phosphorylated upon insulin stimulation and have adaptor function between the insulin receptor and other cellular substrates such as the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3kinase) (65)(66)(67)(68).The contribution of IRS-1 and IRS-2 to insulin resistance and diabetes was recently tested by targeted disruption of the respective gene in mice.IRS-1 knockout mice were insulin resistant but not hyperglycemic (69).It has been shown that the recently cloned IRS-2 was at least partially able to compensate for the lack of IRS-1, which could explain the mild and nondiabetic phenotype of IRS-1 knockout mice (70).In the meantime, IRS-2 knockout mice have also been generated.Although IRS-1 and IRS-2 are highly homologous proteins and share many signaling properties, the phenotype of IRS-2 knockout mice is markedly different from that of IRS-1 knockout mice (71).IRS-2-deficient mice are severely hyperglycemic due to abnormalities of peripheral insulin action and failure of -cell secretion (71).This phenotype with severe hyperglycemia as a consequence of peripheral insulin resistance and insufficient insulin secretion due to a significantly reduced -cell mass reveals many similarities to type 2 diabetes in man and outlines the role of IRS proteins for the development of cellular insulin resistance and -cell function.PI 3,4,5-phosphate (PIP 3 ).PIP 3 can bind PKB/AKT (for cellular homolog of the transforming oncogene v-akt) and phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-phosphate-dependent kinase-1 (PDK-1) by their PH (pleckstrin homologous) domains (72).Colocalization of PKB/AKT and PDK-1 at the plasma membrane region enables phosphorylation of PKB/AKT on threonine 308 by PDK-1.PKB/AKT regulates several protein kinase cascades involved in insulin signal transduction to glucose uptake, to glycolysis, to glycogen synthesis as well as to protein synthesis (73).In addition to phosphorylation of PKB/AKT, there is evidence that PDK-1 is also able to phosphorylate protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms (74,75).Insulindependent activation of the atypical PKC isoform has been demonstrated recently (76).Recent evidence suggests that PDK-1 mediates insulin-dependent activation of atypical PKC through phosphorylation on threonine 410 in the activation loop (74,75).In addition, insulin-dependent stimulation of atypical PKC has been shown to mediate insulin effects on protein synthesis (76).Moreover, there is evidence that the atypical PKC isoforms and are involved in coupling of the insulin signal to the glucose transport system (77,78).This demonstrates that insulin-stimulated glucose transport can be mediated via different signaling cascades.This signaling diversity potentially opens compensatory mechanisms if gene mutations were to occur, for example, in PKB/ AKT or atypical PKCs.",

      "\tComplexity of proteomic and metabolomic analysis\n\nProteomics holds conceptually greater promise as an additional measure of disease-related genetic change given that it takes the \"genetic phenotype\" of RNA expression at least one step closer to the ultimate clinical phenotype of interest.However, with proteins and their multiple derivatives an enormous amount of complexity is introduced and this currently is difficult to resolve [75].Proteomic and metabolomic measurements can be exquisitely sensitive to changes in the concentrations of specific proteins and metabolites [23].However, the task of de novo identification of novel protein products and metabolites is more daunting than that of RNA profiling.In comparison, transcriptomic measurements, which rely on the identification of simple four-nucleotide polymers, whether measured by oligonucleotide arrays or RNA sequencing, are currently more amenable to disease gene identification.Thus, genome-wide analyses of very large numbers of proteins and metabolites, potentially orders of magnitude greater than RNA species, currently are limited by their inability to simultaneously identify and measure all possible species encoded by the genome.This is a technical issue which eventually should be resolved by better high-throughput high-resolution technology and likely will become a valuable adjunct to future transcriptomic analysis It should be noted that there is not a simple 1:1 relationship between RNA expression and protein expression (including expression of covalently modified proteins) and this situation is even more complex for the biosynthesis and use of metabolites.This lack of a simple relationship between RNA expression and protein/metabolite expression makes interpretation of proteomic and metabolomic data challenging.In this regard, one lesson that may be drawn from GWAS analyses is that larger datasets may not always provide simple answers in multifactorial diseases where the underlying structure is very complex.For example, a small proportion of a given protein may become highly active after phosphorylation and become capable of initiating an exponential intracellular catalytic cascade of activity out of proportion to the expression of the original non-phosphorylated protein.Thus, the concentrations of multiple phosphorylated and dephosphorylated proteins may need to be measured (not to mention the concentrations of numerous other types of covalently modified proteins).As with GWAS, eQTL and transcriptomic correlations, the measurable proteomic and metabolomic changes are ultimately encoded within the genome and transferred via expression of RNAs to eventually interact with the intracellular and extra-cellular environment.",
      "\tConclusion\n\nOur study represents the first multi-platform approach to the metabolome-wide analyses of diabetes in a general population.The identification of biomarkers allowing prediction of disease progression and its complications from such studies would be certainly beneficial.However, for the caveats discussed above, we feel that this study should be considered as a pilot for future work.One major finding of our work is the identification of a series of known, and also some novel, deregulated metabolites that associate with diabetes under sub-clinical conditions in the general population.These metabolites have been discovered by integrative metabolomics applying different platforms including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS).Out of the multitude of metabolites measured, a holistic view of differences reflecting global variations in pathophysiology emerges from our study.The coverage of the metabolome's diversity allows the detection of systemic metabolic imbalances, thereby providing a disease-specific picture of human physiology (Figure 3).A pronounced increase in the sample size in future studies will likely allow for further detection of other metabolites of unrecognized associations with diabetic pathways.Finally, our study shows how functional metabolomics can contribute to obtaining a more sophisticated classification of the disease as well as rational optimization of diagnostic and treatment options, as recently suggested by Bain et al.

      "\t\n\nFuture directionsdWe have emphasized GEI in this Perspective because this is where most of the published research has been focused to date.A complementary set of disease predictors is being generated with the emergence of comprehensive metabolomic approaches, in which circulating small molecules present in human fluids are assayed in a high-throughput manner through liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy.These molecules represent metabolic readouts of cellular states at a systems level and reflect the output of gene products and also their interactions with the environment.Using these platforms, independent groups have established a metabolomic signature of branched chain and aromatic amino acids as associated with obesity and insulin resistance (60) as well as future diabetes (61).How genes regulate circulating levels of these molecules, what they tell us about gene function, how much they reflect environmental factors, and to what extent they provide orthogonal information for diabetes prediction and treatment response is the subject of intense investigation.The participant-level integrated assessment of variation in the genome, metabolome, and other aspects of the physiome (e.g., microbiome, transcriptome, and proteome) in large cohorts has not previously been possible, but with recent advances in technology and analytical methods, and cost reductions, this is now feasible and is evolving into a new field called systems epidemiology (Fig. 1).This topic is eloquently reviewed elsewhere (62,63).",

      "\tAbnormalities in Long Non-Coding RNA (lncRNAs) expression\n\nLong non-coding RNAs include non-protein coding transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides (175,176).They have both nuclear and cytoplasmic location and work as signal amplifiers for biological activity, regulating gene expression through a variety of partly explored molecular mechanisms, including the interaction or competition with other RNAs, DNA binding proteins, and specific regulatory DNA sequences (176,177).New increasing evidences show the involvement of lncRNAs in human diseases (178), such as cardiometabolic diseases (179)(180)(181)(182).For example, in the context of atherosclerosis (Figure 1), experimental studies have shown altered expression of lncRNAs in several processes implicated in SMC proliferation, endothelial function, inflammatory cells, lipid metabolism and obesity, as well as with insulin resistance (183), while clinical studies have demonstrated that circulating lncRNAs could be potentially used to predict type 2 DM (182) or the outcome of heart failure (184).However, data from this kind of studies are still initial and in progress.The first lncRNA robustly associated with CVD and type 2 DM has been lncANRIL, a locus identified by GWA studies, already widely discussed in this review in the Section \"Genetic Polymorphisms.\" Metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) is an lncRNA particularly expressed in the nucleus and physiologically implicated in the regulation of endothelial cell function.It has been demonstrated that hyperglicemia alters MALAT1 expression, leading to micro-and macrovascular damages (185)(186)(187).In particular, at a molecular level, MALAT1, by targeting serum amyloid antigen 3, a proinflammatory ligand, has been shown to induce the expression of IL-6 and TNF-, as well as ROS production, thereby promoting endothelial dysfunction (187).Recently, the lncRNA H19, which has a role in limiting body weight and cell proliferation, was found to be markedly reduced in a mouse model of diabetic cardiomyopathy as a consequence of hyperglycemia (188).In an elegant study, it was demonstrated that lncRNA H19, via mIR-675, targets VDAC1, a mitochondrial porin that plays a role in ATP transport, regulating cardiomyocyte apoptosis (188).In other cases, lnc RNAs have been implicated in diabetic vascular complications through mechanisms linked to macrophage-mediated inflammation.By transcriptome profiling of bone marrow-derived macrophages from db/db and diet-induced insulin-resistant type 2 diabetic mice, an increase in lncRNA E330013P06 has been observed, demonstrating that this lncRNA promoted foam cell formation and endothelial dysfunction through the expression of inflammatory genes like Nos2, IL6 and ptgs2 (189).Also, a recent study using RAW264.7,as well as bone-derived macrophages, showed that lncRNA Lethe exerted an anti-inflammatory role by inhibiting the translocation of NF-kB transcription factor to the nucleus, and that in the presence of high glucose concentrations, lncRNA Lethe expression was reduced, with a consequent increment in NOX2 gene expression and ROS production (190).",
      "\tncRNAs AND AGING\n\nncRNAs are the most recent players in the epigenetics field, influencing seemingly all biological processes in virtually all organisms.The advent and widespread use of deep sequencing has provided unbiased insights into the eukaryotic genome, including the existence and functional roles of ncRNAs.In contrast to earlier beliefs, it is now widely accepted that approximately 60 to 90% of the human genome is transcribed, with some variability observed in other organisms (165,166), giving rise to an enormous array of ncRNAs (165)(166)(167)(168)(169). Until recently, most of the studies focused on the short ncRNAs, but the functional importance of long ncRNAs (lncRNAs) is now becoming apparent.Although it is likely that the majority of these functions are epigenetic, with the ncRNAs having significant influence on modulating gene expression and chromatin packaging, the complete array of biological functions of ncRNAs is yet to be understood (170,171).Disruption of ncRNA function has been implicated in numerous disease conditions, such as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, cardiovascular disorders, and aging (172,173).\t\n\nOne of the most notable features of human aging is neurodegeneration and reduced brain function.Premature death of neurons is considered to be a major feature of neurodegenerative diseases.Studies of neurodegenerative processes implicate ncRNAs.Whereas some of the miRNAs correlate with neuroprotection, others clearly contribute toward neurodegenerative diseases and/or aging (173).For example, the mir-34 family appears to be an important determinant for brain aging in flies and maybe also in worms (185).There are higher levels of mir-34 in Alzheimer's disease mouse model brains and samples collected from Alzheimer's disease patients (186,187).The prosurvival factor BCL2 and the antiaging deacetylase SIRT1 both serve as targets of mir-34, and the expression of the latter correlates inversely with mir-34 expression (181,188), revealing a potential mechanism for mir-34 function in the aged brain.Similarly, another miRNA, mir-144, seems to be enriched in aged brains and may also contribute to age-associated neurodegeneration through down-regulation of key protective factors (173).Genetic studies have demonstrated that the longevity-modulating miRNAs lin-4 and lin-14 in C. elegans function in the same pathway as DAF-2 and DAF-16 (178), modulating life span through the insulin/ insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling pathway.There are reports of multiple miRNAs involved in the mTOR pathway, although experimental evidence of these miRNAs regulating life span is still limited (181).Clearly, changes in miRNA levels during aging are a means to regulate target gene expression, in addition to chromatin changes.lncRNAs themselves also serve as important regulators of transcription through their interaction with chromatin or chromatinassociated factors, modulating aging and senescence directly or indirectly.One such example includes a specific lncRNA, Gas5, which is highly expressed in aged mice brain and has been associated with impaired learning (189).Another bona fide example is H19 lncRNA, a differentially spliced product from the H19 gene located at the IGF2/H19 imprinted locus, which interacts with methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 1 to form a complex to repress expression of an imprinted gene network in mice (190).Loss of imprinting from the IGF2/H19 locus has been shown during aging in both mice and human prostate associated with reexpression of certain inactive genes and loss of binding of chromatin-associated protein CTCF (191).This may serve as a potential reason for increased prostate cancer occurrence in aging men, further supporting the connection between aging and cancer development.Other lncRNAs that are implicated in major senescence-associated pathways, such as p53/p21 pathways, are differentially expressed in proliferating early passage compared to senescent late-passage fibroblast cells (192,193).Similarly, differential expression patterns of various lncRNAs have been implicated in the pathophysiology of another age-onset neurological disorder, Huntington's disease, wherein some of these lncRNAs have been postulated to modulate chromatin architecture and/or transcription (194,195).Other ncRNAs, mostly products of the RNAi pathway, are involved in heterochromatin assembly in repetitive DNA elements in diverse organisms (196).Here, they function to target histone-modifying activities in DNA repeats through reader proteins.Other ncRNAs act to organize the three-dimensional organization of chromosomes or as boundaries or insulators to prevent the spreading of heterochromatin (197).Whether the changes in chromatin structure that occur during aging are due to changes in these particular ncRNAs is yet to be examined.\t\n\nThe occurrence of ncRNAs has been highly conserved through evolution; even budding yeast is now appreciated to have many ncRNAs.ncRNA transcription from the rDNA locus, which is silent under normal conditions, serves as a life span determinant of this unicellular organism through its function to regulate rDNA stability (174).Mutations that prevent expression of the ncRNAs from the rDNA locus lead to life span extension in budding yeast (174).As discussed above, expression of the ncRNAs from Alu elements during adult human stem cell aging ex vivo promotes entry into senescence, and knockdown of the Alu transcripts reverses senescence (70).During aging of both worms and mice, a decline in either mRNA or protein level has been observed for Dicer (175), suggesting likely defective small ncRNA (sncRNA) processing in these organisms during aging.Indeed, the majority of microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of sncRNAs, have been shown to be down-regulated with age (175)(176)(177).Notably, this phenotype can be reversed following CR in mice (175).In the absence of Dicer in mice, there are signs of early senescence, signifying its role in longevity (175).A decrease in Dicer levels has also been observed in adipocytes collected from elderly humans, suggesting the possibility of a conserved mechanism of sncRNA dysregulation during aging in mammals (175).miRNAs are sncRNAs that negatively control their target gene expression posttranscriptionally and have been implicated in aging.Although miRNAs do not alter the chromatin structure, they are considered mediators of epigenetics because they lead to heritable changes in gene expression that do not involve a change in DNA sequence.The best-characterized examples of roles of miRNAs during aging come from studies in C. elegans.Several miRNAs have been shown to be involved in modulating life span and in controlling tissue aging (178,179).One of the most prominent examples includes the regulation of aging by the miRNA lin-4 and its pro-aging target miRNA lin-14 (178).Loss of function of lin-4 shortens life span, whereas overexpression of lin-4 extends life span.In contrast, knocking down lin-14, even in adult animals, extends life span (178).The key question is what are the target genes of lin-14 that are regulating aging?Of all the miRNAs reported in C. elegans, more than a quarter are differentially expressed during aging, including some of the miRNA families conserved with humans (176,177,179).Whereas some miRNAs have an antiaging effect by promoting longevity in C. elegans, others show a pro-aging effect by antagonizing longevity (177,179,180).Even the expression pattern of some miRNAs serves as a predictor of longevity.However, the evolutionarily conserved nature of some of these miRNAs indicates that their role in life span regulation likely extends beyond this organism to larger eukaryotes, including humans.Differential expression of miRNAs is also evident in mice and humans during aging, although the differences are not always present in all organs (181)(182)(183)(184).",
      "\t\n\nThe long noncoding RNA (lncRNAs) are a different class of noncoding RNAs of approximately 200 nucleotides in length and lacking open reading frames [52].Recent studies show the role of lncRNAs during ageing [47].It was identified that MIR31HG is positively regulated in oncogenes induced by senescence and required for the repression of the INK4A locus mediated by Polycomb groups [53].Other studies showed that Meg3 is positively regulated both in cardiovascular ageing and in senescent human umbilical venous endothelial cells [47].Although the majority of studies of lncRNAs have been anecdotal, it is worth mentioning that the use of the CRISPR-Cas9 technique of functional lncRNAs41 will allow future studies to understand the functions of lncRNA in the ageing process [54] (for more details, see Chap.10).\t\n\nLong noncoding RNAs are important regulators of transcriptional networks and the closed or opened chromatin state [2].One interesting example of an lncRNA is that associated with aging, H19.This lncRNA interacts with MBD1 (a methyl-CpG-binding domain protein) to suppress the expression of several genes, including a gene likely to have implications for aging, Igf2, which encodes an insulin-like growth factor [67].The loss of Igf2 imprinting occurs with aging in histologically normal human prostate tissues, and this epigenetic alteration is more extensive in men with prostate cancer [68].\tLong Non-coding RNAs\n\nLong Non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) consist of RNA molecules with more than 200 nucleotides that do not translate into protein.There are more than 14,000 lncRNAs, which are generally transcribed by RNA pol II and are subjected to transcriptional modifications and splicing [153,154].They can be found in the nucleus, cytosol or mitochondria, and their biological function is to form different types of complexes by interacting with proteins and nucleic acids in order to regulate gene expression (by indirect epigenetic mechanisms or by direct mechanisms acting as antisense transcripts or transcriptional coactivators), nuclear location of transcription factors and stabilization of ribonucleoprotein complexes [155].It has been reported that lncRNAs are important in the regulation of ageing-associated mechanisms in humans and animal models, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and senescence [113].Recent studies have identified several lncRNAs differentially expressed in senescent and young fibroblasts, such as the senescence-associated lncRNA (SALNR) that maintains cellular senescence via inhibition of NF90 nucleolus translocation (which inhibits expression of senescence-associated mRNAs and miRNAs) and the SAL-RNA1 associated with the hallmarks of cellular senescence [156,157].\tNoncoding RNA\n\nTwo classes of noncoding RNAs are intensely studied concerning ageing: micro RNAs (miRNAs) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs).\t\n\nOne important contribution of RNA-seq to genomic studies is its high confidence in the discovery of novel transcripts such as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs).These transcripts remained largely undiscovered because its analysis using microarrays was very expensive before NGS technology advent.lncRNAs are a heterogeneous class of RNA transcripts that are not transcribed into proteins, are longer than 200 nt, and are highly spatial-temporal regulated.In a study using prefrontal cortex samples from 2 to 60 years old individuals, it was found that during prefrontal cortex aging, certain groups of lncRNAs change their expression in an age-related manner.Some lncRNAs like MALAT1 or Gomafu were associated with specific age-related phenotypes like age-dependent decrease in neurogenesis [58,59].Also, the identification of differentially expressed ncRNAs between young adult (4 months) and aged male mouse livers (28 months) showed that several non-coding RNAs participate in the molecular regulation of age-related changes in the liver.For example, Neat1 is a downregulated lncRNA involved in the paraspeckle formation and nuclear retention of mRNAs in aged livers [60,61].Also, mtDNA-transcribed lncRNA (ASncmtRNA2) is a mitochondrially encoded lncRNA which overexpression participates in the regulation of age-associated cardiovascular diseases as it is a non-canonical precursor for hsa-miR-4485 and hsa-miR-1973 microRNAs [62].These studies demonstrate that not only coding genes (which represent only 2% of the genome sequence) are implicated in aging regulation, but also lncRNAs and microRNAs participate in tissue age-related changes.",

      "\tLong non-coding RNAs in metabolism and metabolic diseases\n\nLncRNAs are emerging as important regulatory elements that control metabolic tissues' development and function [47].Regulation of metabolism and glucose homeostasis are fundamental biochemical processes, orchestrated, and fine-tuned by reciprocal signaling between different tissues/organs that serve regulatory functions, including absorption of sugar from the intestine, secretion of insulin from the pancreas, glucose production in the liver, and uptake of glucose by fat, muscle, and other tissues.Pancreatic islets have a critical role in regulating systemic glucose metabolism through the secretion of key Fig. 3 Cellular events that are modulated by lncRNAs.LncR-NAs regulate cellular mechanisms by epigenetic modification, transcription regulation, small ncRNA processing, and post-transcriptional regulation.Epigenetic modifications include DNA methylation and histone modifications.Transcriptional regulation includes protein-protein interactions that might affect transcription, transcriptional activation/inhibition, and nuclear localization of transcription factors.Small ncRNA processing, additionally, also involves splicing of lncRNA into siRNA by DICER.Post-transcriptional regulation includes alternate splicing, mRNA stability, miRNA sequestration, mRNA degradation, and translational inhibition endocrine hormones, insulin and glucagon, where insulin is the anabolic master regulator which controls peripheral as well as central nervous system-related aspects of metabolism.Resistance towards insulin action is a key step in the development of metabolic disorders.Dysregulation of any of these processes underlies the pathogenesis of major metabolic disorders including obesity, Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), dyslipidemia, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).The discovery of lncRNAs has added a new layer of complexity to the regulatory network that impinges on metabolic homeostasis and disease [48].Interestingly, several GWAS studies have reported lncR-NAs to be mapped to diabetic susceptible loci [49][50][51][52], all suggesting towards critical roles of lncRNAs in insulin resistance, diabetes, and its associated complications.",
      "\t\n\nLong chain noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are more than 200 nucleotides in length.LncRNAs regulate transcriptional and posttranscriptional RNA processing, translation, DNA methylation, and chromatin architecture via local (cis) and distal (trans) mechanisms.It is generally considered that they do not encode proteins but can be involved in various biological regulatory functions.Lin suggested that the lncRNA HOTAIR promotes the development of Parkinson's disease by targeting miR-126 [10].Gu suggested that the lncRNA EBF3-AS promotes neuronal apoptosis in Alzheimer's disease [11].J-X Pan suggested that lncRNA H19 promotes atherosclerosis progression.LncRNA H19 was recently reported to play a crucial role in the activation of MAPK and the NF-kB signaling pathway and the induction of atherosclerosis [3].lncRNAs play crucial roles in the progression of diabetic nephropathy [12], glomerular disease [13] and renal fibrosis [14].The lncRNA Arid-IR promotes NF-kB-mediated kidney inflammation by targeting NLRC5 transcription [15].The cell cycle changes during aging.Previous studies have shown that lncRNAs are related to cell proliferation and are closely related to cell cycle progression.LncRNA ANRIL inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell senescence by alleviating cell cycle arrest [16].The lncRNA CASC11 can promote gastric cancer cell apoptosis by accelerating the cell cycle process [17].The study of lncRNAs in kidney aging is still in its infancy, and we asked whether lncRNAs could regulate the process of kidney aging.\t\n\nBackground: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in physiological and pathological processes.However, no studies have been conducted on the relationship between lncRNAs and renal aging.",
      "\t\n\nWhile changes in gene expression profiles have been used as biomarkers for aging and sometimes even as predictors of biological aging rate [8], the ultimate aim in studying the aging transcriptome is to elucidate the pathways that define age-related degenerative processes and the responses they evoke, in a tissue-specific manner.For this purpose it is essential to collect mRNA expression data in the context of their non-mRNA, gene regulatory RNAs.Indeed, as mentioned, apart from the canonical protein-coding mRNAs, which make up about 3 % of the genome, the critical role of a multitude of ncRNAs are now well recognized.NcRNA is a broad umbrella term that includes pseudogenes, or those genes that have lost their protein-coding potential but are sometimes still capable of being transcribed [11], long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), typically >200 nucleotides long, which have been shown to perform a wide range of functions from transcriptional de-repression to silencing [12], and small ncRNAs (<200 nucleotides in length), which are mainly comprise the regulatory microRNAs (miRNAs), small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), and transfer RNAs (tRNAs).Although species in this last category are small, they may have a large impact on cellular function, regulating such processes as gene silencing, splicing, and translation [13].The role of ncRNAs in aging remains unclear, which essentially constrains attempts to generate comprehensive functional networks of tissuespecific alterations in the RNA landscape.\t\n\nA major challenge in attempts to fully characterize the transcriptional landscape at old age is linking altered mRNA expression levels to altered ncRNAs, recently highlighted as a key regulatory component of the transcriptome and in aging [14,57].Our results show that roughly 13 % of the transcripts we found altered with age are those of ncRNAs.Although many of these ncRNAs have been previously reported and studied, such as the lncRNAs Meg3, Rian, and Neat1, none of these to our knowledge have been implicated in aging.Additionally, it is noted that the Dlk-Dio3 locus in mouse corresponds to the largest hotspot of miRNAs within its genome.Interestingly, a previous report has shown that eight miRNAs originating within this cluster are downregulated in aged skeletal muscle [29].Coupled with our findings that lncRNAs (Meg3, Rian, Mirg) from this locus are upregulated in aging liver, we can conclusively define this locus as cell-type specific regulatory hotspot in aging.Whether this locus plays a major regulatory role in the aging process remains to be elucidated, but could be studied by testing if multiple proteins and/or pathways which are targeted are actually affected in aging tissues.In addition to known ncRNAs, we also revealed novel lncRNA transcripts differentially expressed with age, such as those flanking the Cdkn2a locus.Given the importance of the Cdkn2a locus in both senescence and cancer, these flanking lncRNAs may offer putative targets to regulate the cell cycle.More evidence for the implications of such ncRNAs in aging will become more apparent as the field expands to functionally characterize each novel ncRNA.Taken together, our results provide the first evidence that ncRNAs can also shape the landscape of aging mouse liver."

      "\tConclusions\n\nThere is no reason to doubt that the development of CRISPR-Cas genome editing represents an unprecedented breakthrough in modern science, as it has potential applications in a wide array of disciplines ranging from agriculture, zoology and renewable energy to biomedicine and synthetic biology.This powerful tool holds promise for further elucidating the molecular causes of ageing by allowing scientists to probe genetic and epigenetic pathways with a level of sophistication that was unattainable just a few years ago.It will allow so in traditional animal and cell models of ageing, but it will also drastically accelerate the generation of refined versions of those models or even allow the development of new research approaches in non-model organisms.Moreover, CRISPR-based genome editing is already having a significant impact in research aiming to understand the cellular and molecular origins of age-related diseases, as well as developing potential treatments against them.The application of CRISPR-Cas gene editing for the treatment of age-related diseases is not over the horizon yet, as it will require the identification of causative genes and their role under a variety of contexts that could be as diverse as the ageing process is across individuals.However, CRISPR-Cas might also hold the key for solving such conundrum, as it has opened the way for achieving true personalised medicine by providing both the precision and scalability required for conducting genome-wide functional screens during the refinement of drug-and cell-based therapies for age-related diseases.\t\n\nSince its discovery, CRISPR-Cas technology has ignited a biological revolution by providing a highly versatile platform that allows fast and efficient genome editing in an ever-growing list of organisms.In this chapter we will first describe the most recent advances in the development and application of the CRISPR-Cas platform in biomedical research.Then we will discuss the most recent and notable basic research applications of this technology in the study of the molecular causes of ageing.Finally, we will review how CRISPR-Cas has been used for creating new models for the study of age-related diseases, as well as for manipulating diseaseassociated gene pathways.\tApplications of CRISPR-Cas in the Study of Ageing-Related Disease Cardiovascular Disease\n\nOne of the most notable contributions of CRISPR-Cas to ageing research is its ability to target non-proliferating cells (contrary to HDR-directed gene targeting), which comprise most cells in adult tissues.Therefore, it can be used both in vitro and in vivo for cell types of great relevance to age-related disease such cardiomyocytes and neurons [97,98].In the heart, the ability to target cardiomyocytes is of great importance, as this organ does not harbour a typical stem cell population.In order to address this issue, a mouse model expressing Cas9 specifically in cardiomyocytes was developed, which allows cardiac-specific targeting of any gene just by injecting the mice with AAVs carrying gene-specific gRNAS [99].Additionally, a number of proof-of-concept studies have shown that CRISPR-Cas can be used to correct in vivo pathogenic mutations present within this cell population [97,98,100] The application of CRISPR-Cas in the study of cardiovascular disease during physiological ageing has yet to be reported.It has, however, been used to rescue the alterations resembling cardiovascular disease observed in mouse models of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) [44,45].Also worth noting is the recent generation by CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing of the first minipig model of HGPS, which has a cardiovascular system similar to that of humans and was shown to recapitulate the cardiovascular alterations found in human HGPS patients [101].\t\n\nGenome editing has always been a challenging area to provide more efficient ways to create a meaningful change in the genome.Today, the CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat) restoration system is considered as one of the suitable and promising options for genome editing.Compared to the previous systems, CRISPR can deactivate or eliminate a gene without interfering with intracellular mechanisms.The system could be used in the treatment of diseases and in related research by identifying the performance of defective genes in these diseases.CRISPR seems to have more potential and applications compared to previous systems.Among these applications, we can note the use of CRISPR in understanding complex genetic and epigenetic conditions such as aging or cancer.The complex interactions between several genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that characterize aging pose significant challenges to scientists attempting to understand this phenomenon and its causes and still constitute a barrier to a better understanding of aging and the ability to develop effective application of CRISPR-cas to aging research.\t\n\nInvestigations into the biological activity of telomerase have also been performed using CRISPR-Cas tools.As an example of this, a loss-of-function mutation was introduced by CRISPR in killifish telomerase, which resulted in the recapitulation of human pathologies seen with telomerase deficiency [53].In another study, CRISPR-Cas9 was used to introduce a fluorescent marker into the TERT locus, allowing the dynamic visualisation of telomerase movement in living cells.This approach revealed that there are three stages of telomerase movement: a fast diffusion stage, a frequent but transient telomere association stage and a rarer but stable association stage that mediates telomere extension [68].Moreover, CRISPR editing revealed that telomerase can bind to single-strand DNA telomere overhangs to catalyse the addition of multiple hexamer repeats in tandem [69].These CRISPR-Cas-based studies provide important insights into the interplay of different molecular mechanisms involved in telomere maintenance during the ageing process and set the basis for future investigations into the spatio-temporal dynamics of the telomerase protein in vivo.\t\n\nAs mentioned previously, damage to telomeres results in an assortment of cellular defects.The ability of the CRISPR-Cas system to delete defined genomic regions or to introduce precise mutations or new genetic elements provides an excellent tool to study telomere damage in living organisms.For example, studies introducing DSBs in telomeres have found that activation of the telomeric repair system is regulated by the Rad51 gene.However, the findings from previous experiments were obscured by confounding factors such as the induction of apoptotic or senescence pathways [14].These caveats were shown to be avoided by the use of CRISPR-Cas9 in order to greatly increase the precision of DSB induction in telomeres [65].In another study, investigators used CRISPR-Cas9 to completely delete the telomeres from neuroblastoma cells and interrogated its effects on cellular function and the induction of senescence [66].This analysis revealed that the complete loss of telomeres in these cells resulted in a loss of mitochondrial function and the aggregation of Parkinson's disease-associated proteins, allowing for the study of cellular ageing.CRISPR-Cas can also be used to introduce more precise mutations in telomeres, such as at the level of a single nucleotide.As an example, a mutation was introduced to the subtelomeric CTCF binding site known as TERRA, resulting in the loss of sister telomeres and impairing replicative potential.This work implicated CTCF and TERRA as being of significant importance for telomere maintenance and replication [67].Further studies utilising the ability of the CRISPR-Cas9 system to remove telomeres in living organisms and in a cell-type-specific manner will allow for a greater understanding of the role that telomere attrition plays during the ageing process and in the development of ageassociated diseases.\t\n\nDue to the evidence shown above, telomere attrition is considered a hallmark of the ageing process [14,63]; and while significant advances have been made in understating the basic biology of telomere function through in vitro research, the translation of this research to an in vivo context has been severely limited.The reason is that although numerous techniques exist to label telomeres and genomic regions, most of these are toxic to cells, can result in the induction of DNA damage or are non-compatible for in vivo applications.The CRISPR-Cas system has facilitated the refinement of these techniques by utilising dCas9 fused to a fluorescent protein, allowing telomeres to be visualised in living mice [64].This work was also combined with CRISPR-Cas9-mediated disruption of the TRF1 gene, which allowed for the real-time observation of the fusion and aggregation of telomeres.This technique can easily be expanded to look at the effects of various genetic manipulations on telomere dynamics in vivo.\tInvestigating the Mechanisms of Longevity\n\nCurrently there have been no studies exploring the utility of the CRISPR-Cas system on experimentally extending the lifespan of physiologically aged laboratory animals.A main issue in this regard is that established vertebrate models already possess relatively long lifespans that make longevity extension studies economically unviable.One approach to circumvent this is to use laboratory animals which show accelerated ageing phenotypes, such as progeroid mice.Progeroid syndromes are rare congenital disorders that mimic physiological ageing but in a significantly accelerated manner, severely reducing the lifespan of affected individuals [36].\t\n\nThe application of CRISPR-Cas in epigenome editing is currently in its infancy.However, the technique holds significant promise for providing clarity to the myriad of epigenetic mechanisms that may impact on the ageing process.In this regard, it must be noted that in comparison to other hallmarks of ageing, the range of discrepancies observed across model species is the broadest in the case of some epigenetic alterations.This prevents the use of many of the most time-cost efficient in vivo models of ageing such as yeast, worms and flies, as they can even lack some of those alterations.Therefore, the use of CRISPR-Cas for the fast and efficient generation of in vitro and in vivo models of higher species will prove invaluable for studying epigenetic mechanisms of ageing that are of relevance to humans.\t\n\nFinally, CRISPR-based functional screening can also be used for discovering novel regulators of genes, pathways or cellular processes of importance to brain ageing or neurodegenerative disease.One study described a CRISPR screening method that led to the identification of two genes that conferred resistance to alphasynuclein toxicity in human neurons [111], while more recently, CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen revealed the role of CD22 in preventing microglial phagocytosis during aging.Notably, when researchers delivered a CD22-blocking antibody to the brains of ageing mice, they observed a restoration of microglial activity and cognitive function [112].\tNeurodegenerative Diseases\n\nIn recent years, CRISPR-Cas technologies have significantly contributed to studies addressing the molecular pathogenesis of age-related neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD).Currently, it has mostly been utilised for developing new or improved tools in which to study the molecular mechanisms underlying these diseases, such as in patient-derived cell lines carrying pathogenic mutations.\t\n\nWhile cellular senescence is appreciated as a hallmark of physiological ageing, it is not simply its consequence as the pharmacological or genetic removal of senescent cells can ameliorate ageing phenotypes in mice [91].Therefore, a more detailed understanding of the induction and maintenance mechanisms of the senescent state will be advantageous in fully dissecting its relation to organismal ageing.To this end, the CRISPR-Cas system has been utilised for performing high-throughput genetic screens of genes and genetic pathways involved such processes.Some identified events include loss of MTOR, CRISPLD2 or MORF4L1, which prevent both senescence and SASP induction, or CHEK2, HAS1 or MDK loss, which promote the bypass of cellular senescence while retaining production of the SASP [92].Conversely, CRISPR-Cas9 functional genetic screens have also identified genes whose deficiency is sufficient to promote the senescent state, such as the SWI/SNF component SMARCB1 in melanoma cells [93].Furthermore, CRISPR-Cas genome editing has been utilised in order to characterise enhancer elements in the genome that are essential for maintaining the senescent state.For example, a CRISPR-Cas9based screen showed that the transcription factor AP-1 is a major regulator of the senescent state following oncogenic stress by interacting with a FOXF1 enhancer, which is hyper-activated in senescent cells and necessary to maintain the cells in senescence [94].",
      "\t\n\nMany genes are having orthologues in animal models and their role in ageing is validated in further downstream analyses or separate studies.Pharmacological treatments in combination with genetic and genomic approaches such as global genetic interactions (for example, through Synthetic Genetic Arrays [75,76]) can help towards building a functional connectome for chronological lifespan and reveal a comprehensive global view of cellular ageing.Following cues from the yeast screens, CRISPR/-Cas9 mediated screens and assays for in mammalian cells [77] can directly provide insights of orthologues and gene-drug relationships even for human cellular lifespan, opening avenues for targeted interventions that would prevent or ameliorate agerelated diseases.",
      "\t\n\nOver the past 8 years, CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-Cas9 (CRISPR-associated protein 9) technologies have emerged as accessible and adaptable tools for studying and altering genomes. 5RISPR-Cas9 can be used to induce genome edits by creating targeted DNA breaks that trigger site-specific DNA repair.In nextgeneration formats, it can also control the transcriptional output of genes or alter genome sequences using a process of nucleotide base editing that does not require repair of DNA breaks.As these technologies continue to mature, it will become increasingly possible to alter cellular genomes efficiently and accurately.\t\n\nComing on the heels of engineered nucleases, CRISPR-Cas9 tools have accelerated the pace of genomic research by permitting highly efficient knockouts or edits of virtually any gene in cells or model organisms.Multiple CRISPR-Cas9-based clinical trials are in progress or are expected to begin soon.Although Cas9engineered cells haven't yet demonstrated efficacy at scale, early trial results suggest that such cells are stable and don't cause acute adverse reactions in humans.Long-term safety is yet to be determined.Current applications largely focus on single-gene disorders for which gene editing can be carried out ex vivo on appropriate cells, such as bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells in the case of sickle cell anemia.Exploration is under way to develop delivery systems that can target the gene-editing apparatus to the appropriate tissue in vivo.",
      "\t\n\nAGING GENES AS TARGETS FOR DRUG DISCOVERY In addition to genes associated with aging, research has focused on identifying genes associated with the lifeextending effects of CR.One method is to identify genes that decrease or cancel out the life-extending effects of CR when mutated (Gems et al., 2002;Bishop and Guarente, 2007).More than 100 such genes have been identified in model organisms (D.Wuttke, C. Vora, J. P. de Magalhes, unpublished observations).The growth hormone receptor (GHR) is the only gene so far identified in mammals that mediates CR lifespan effects (Bonkowski et al., 2006); most CR-related genes have been identified in lower life forms, such as yeast, flies, and worms (http://genomics.senescence.info/diet/).Nonetheless, most of these genes have mammalian homologs and represent potential targets for interventions to improve human health and/or optimize a healthy diet (Fig. 1).Potential pharmacological interventions may be developed by targeting these genes and pathways; examples of this approach are discussed below.",
      "\t\n\nClustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas nucleases have revolutionized the field of gene editing and have tremendous application in the field of molecular medicine [98][99][100][101][102].Despite a significant surge in CRISPR/Cas9mediated genome editing in various disease models, the progress in the field of AD has lagged behind substantially.We believe that genome editing can significantly improve the development of AD models and also create novel opportunities for the development of the next generation precision targeted AD gene and stem cell therapies.Since there are several excellent review articles on CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing, here we will limit our focus on select recent articles that are noteworthy.CRISPR/Cas9 system can be engineered to either activate transcription (gain-of-function) or achieve gene silencing (Loss-of-function).Dahlman et al. have developed a CRISPR-based system that uses catalytically active Cas9 and distinct single guide (sgRNA) constructs to activate and knockout different genes in the same cell [103].Konermann et al. have used structure-guided engineering of a CRISPR-Cas9 complex to mediate efficient transcriptional activation at endogenous genomic loci [104].Using crystallographic studies, they have engineered a combination of sgRNA2.0,NLS-dCas9-VP64 and MS2-p65-HSF1 to develop one of the most effective transcription activation system.",
      "\t\n\nA number of recent technological advances provide promising leads toward addressing these challenges (Table S2).Singlecell/low cell number genomics (Nawy, 2014;Shankaranarayanan et al., 2011) may prove to be critically important in identifying mutations in key epigenetic enzymes and/or aberrant patterns of epigenetic modifications in specific disease cohorts or cell types.Continuing advances in CRISPR (Cong et al., 2013) technology, including use of CRISPR technology for enzyme targeting, will also provide new methods for genetic and epigenetic manipulation.In particular, genomics coupled with direct manipulation of epigenetic factors and targeted epigenetic reprogramming will greatly advance our understanding of the role of epigenetic changes that are causal to aging."

      "\t\n\nFailure to restore NAD + bioavailability, in response to DDR, negatively affects the cellular redox balance, which exacerbates oxidative and metabolic stress (Fig. 3) [99,100].DNA damage stimulates mitochondrial fusion [101], mitochondrial OXPHOS activity, and cellular metabolism to supply cells with ATP and NAD + in order to restore cellular homeostasis [102,103].In cells that sustain high levels of DNA damage, persistent activation of DDR creates a high-energy demand, and a cascade of events leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic stress.Consistent with this, human diseases characterized by defects in DNA repair, including Cockayne Syndrome (CS) [75,104], Xeroderma Pigmentosum (XP) [105], and Ataxia Telangiectasia (A-T) [106,107], are characterized by loss of energy homeostasis, and defective mitophagy.We propose that the pathways involved with the activation of PARP1 and the ensuing depletion of cellular NAD + and ATP contribute to the premature aging features in these diseases, as described above (Fig. 3).\t\n\nThe biology of aging is an area of intense research, and many questions remain about how and why cell and organismal functions decline over time.In mammalian cells, genomic instability and mitochondrial dysfunction are thought to be among the primary drivers of cellular aging.This review focuses on the interrelationship between genomic instability and mitochondrial dysfunction in mammalian cells and its relevance to age-related functional decline at the molecular and cellular level.The importance of oxidative stress and key DNA damage response (DDR) pathways in cellular aging is discussed, with a special focus on poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1, whose persistent activation depletes cellular energy reserves, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, loss of energy homeostasis, and altered cellular metabolism.Elucidation of the relationship between genomic instability, mitochondrial dysfunction, and the signaling pathways that connect these pathways/processes are key to the future of research on human aging.An important component of mitochondrial health preservation is mitophagy, and this and other areas that are particularly ripe for future investigation will be discussed\t\nThe biology of aging is an area of intense research, and many questions remain about how and why cell and organismal functions decline over time.In mammalian cells, genomic instability and mitochondrial dysfunction are thought to be among the primary drivers of cellular aging.This review focuses on the interrelationship between genomic instability and mitochondrial dysfunction in mammalian cells and its relevance to age-related functional decline at the molecular and cellular level.The importance of oxidative stress and key DNA damage response (DDR) pathways in cellular aging is discussed, with a special focus on poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1, whose persistent activation depletes cellular energy reserves, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, loss of energy homeostasis, and altered cellular metabolism.Elucidation of the relationship between genomic instability, mitochondrial dysfunction, and the signaling pathways that connect these pathways/processes are key to the future of research on human aging.An important component of mitochondrial health preservation is mitophagy, and this and other areas that are particularly ripe for future investigation will be discussed\nAccepted ArticleThis article is protected by copyright.All rights reserved.defects in DNA repair, and improved understanding of the signaling pathways that connect these processes are important for future research on human aging. DNA damage response pathwaysAll cells are continuously exposed to endogenous agents that cause DNA damage, including reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and environmental sources of DNA damaging agents, such as radiation, chemical mutagens and carcinogens.It is estimated that approximately 10 5 DNA lesions accumulate in the human genome per cell per day [4].Figure 1 summarizes the classes of DNA damage and the primary cellular mechanism responsible for repairing each class of DNA damage [5].In mammalian cells, nucleotide excision repair (NER) is the primary pathway for repair of bulky DNA lesions, including those generated by ultraviolet light, environmental and chemical mutagens [6].Base excision repair (BER) removes damaged bases caused by oxidation, alkylation, deamination, and spontaneous hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond [7].Single-strand DNA breaks (SSBs) and double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) are among the most genotoxic DNA lesions.DSBs can lead to chromosomal rearrangements and genomic instability that can trigger cell death and/or senescence [8].Mammalian cells express four distinct DSB repair (DSBR) pathways: homologous recombination (HR), non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), alternative end joining (Alt-EJ) and single strand annealing (SSA).Since NHEJ ligates free ends it is a mutagenic process whereas HR is thought to be error free.Notably, NHEJ is less mutagenic than Alt-EJ, and SSA pathways, which are highly error-prone and promote chromosomal rearrangements and genomic instability [9,10].The mechanisms and factors that determine which pathway repairs a specific DSB in a specific cell include cell cycle phase, efficiency of DNA end-resection, and status of RecQ helicase expression, and post-translational modification [9][10][11].When a cell's capacity to repair DNA lesions is compromised or exceeded, persistent DNA lesions can accumulate and block DNA replication forks and inhibit cell cycle progression in proliferating cells.Replication fork blockage can, in some cases, be overcome by activating secondary origins of replication or by enabling lesion bypass by an error-prone translesion DNA polymerases [12].Cells that harbor a defect in one or more DNA repair pathways, accumulate persistent DNA damage and typically exhibit an elevated mutation rate [2,13].Many theories have been advanced to explain why and how organisms age, and one of the prevalent ones proposes that time-dependent accumulation of DNA damage and genetic mutations plays a major causal role in aging.Consistent with this hypothesis, several heritable human disorders characterized by accelerated aging are caused by mutant alleles in DNA repair genes which impairs DNA repair capacity [14].Thus, human premature aging disorders are strongly associated with defects in DSBR,",

      "\tDiscussion\n\nAlthough great attention has been paid to the potential relationship between aging and DNA DSB repair, the major descriptive and mechanistic studies were performed in rodent models. 3,4,6,11,17,23Relevant research in humans was mainly focused on age-related change in the recruitment kinetics of essential DNA damage response factors, assayed by immune-staining; 26 age-related change of genomic instability, measured by comet assay; 7 age-related change of expression profile of important DNA repair factors, analyzed by RNA array and proteomic tools. 27,28Although the previous work greatly advanced our understanding of age-associated changes of DNA DSB repair, due to a lack of proper tools for the analysis of NHEJ and HR efficiency and fidelity separately, and the hardship of acquiring a sufficient number of human samples, whether NHEJ efficiency and fidelity, and HR efficiency change with age in humans and the consequences of any such change, and its underlying molecular mechanism are not well understood.Here, we established 50 eyelids fibroblast cell lines derived from donors who are evenly distributed by age.With these cell lines, using our well-characterized reporters for the analysis of NHEJ and HR capacities, for the first time, we conclusively demonstrate that both DNA repair pathways decline with age.The impaired recruitment of Rad51 to DNA damage sites during aging hampers the ability of aged cells to choose the precise HR pathway, forcing cells to utilize the error-prone NHEJ pathway.Simultaneously, because of decreased expression of XRCC4, DNA Lig4 and DNA Lig3 during aging, NHEJ becomes more inefficient and inaccurate with age, leaving more damage sites repaired with a loss of more genetic information.The declined DNA DSB repair by both pathways then leads to accumulation of DNA mutations, posing more damages to both NHEJ and HR repair machineries, eventually exacerbating the age-related rise of genomic instability (Figure 8).Our previous reports indicate that the efficiency of DNA DSB repair by NHEJ and HR declines, and NHEJ becomes more error-prone with replicative cellular senescence. 21,29In presenescent cells, HR efficiency declines by 38-fold, whereas NHEJ changes by only ~two to threefold.Consistent with the above results, our current aging study also shows a sharp decline of HR efficiency during aging, with the biggest difference of an ~30-fold change, whereas the change of NHEJ with age is relatively mild, albeit statistically significant.However, contradictorily, knocking out major NHEJ factors, such as DNA-PKcs, Ku70, Ku80 or Artemis in mice leads to a phenotype of progeria, 4 whereas knocking out HR factors usually leads to a phenotype of embryonic lethality, 4,30,31 suggesting that NHEJ is more likely to be involved in aging.Considering an organism's life history is likely critical for reconciling these observations.During embryogenesis cells are rapidly dividing and therefore undergoing replication stress; complete loss of HR, which is a dominant pathway for relieving replication stress, 32 may cause cells to enter apoptosis by activating P53, leading to embryonic lethality.However, the embryonic lethality could mask the roles of HR in aging.Indeed, partial loss of HR might also lead to agingassociated phenotypes.For instance, BRCA1 heterozygous mice are short lived and have a premature aging phenotype in the ovaries. 33,34Intriguingly, once an organism has developed into adulthood, a gradual suppression of the HR pathway with age is needed to counteract the potential tumorigenesis as uncontrolled or overactive single-strand annealing (SSA), which shares almost identical repair machinery with the HR pathway, 35 may cause loss of large genomic fragments due to the prevalence of repetitive sequences in human genomes.",
      "\t\n\nA similar duality is emerging in mammals, where defective DNA repair is often associated with premature aging (Lombard et al., 2005), yet the lack of a DNA damage response can be beneficial in situations of chronic DNA damage due to telomere dysfunction (Choudhury et al., 2007;Schaetzlein et al., 2007).Furthermore, exposure to genotoxic stress early in life seems to accelerate changes in gene expression that have been associated with age-related diseases such as amyloidogenesis (Wu et al., 2008).Interestingly, we found that constitutive overexpression of a set of age-deregulated SIRT1 target genes promotes apoptosis in primary neurons (Figure S11); however more work is needed to determine the physiological relevance of this observation.\t\n\nThere is some evidence that related processes occur in mammals.First, cells damaged by oxidative stress in vitro undergo stochastic transcriptional changes that parallel those in aged heart tissue (Bahar et al., 2006).Second, a deficiency in the DNA repair factor ERCC1 accelerates aging phenotypes and generates gene expression profiles reminiscent of aged animals (Niedernhofer et al., 2006).Third, cells that senesce because of replicative aging in vitro or in aged tissues in vivo exhibit alterations in heterochromatin (Herbig et al., 2006;Narita et al., 2006) and secrete growth factors that can drive tumorigenesis (Campisi, 2005).Finally, oxidative DNA damage at promoters correlates with gene repression in the aging human brain (Lu et al., 2004) and has been linked to both transcriptional and epigenetic changes that may contribute to Alzheimer's disease (Wu et al., 2008).",
      "\tAging\n\nThe oxidative stress theory of aging proposes that accumulation of oxidative DNA damage over the life span of an organism leads to gradual decline of cellular functions and eventual death (Bohr, 2002).This model is supported by several circumstantial evidences including the observation that lower free radical production and/or antioxidant treatment protects against agerelated deterioration, and cognitive decline (Lemon et al., 2003).Further, deficit or decrease in the repair of oxidative DNA damage appears to correlate with premature aging and age-related diseases (Bohr et al., 2007).It appears likely that overall genome repair, specifically the balance between DNA damage and its repair is a major determinant of the longevity and cell viability.A specific defect in processing 5 0 dRP residue at the strand break in Sir2 (SIRT6 homolog)-deficient mice displayed age-related degenerative phenotype (Mostoslavsky et al., 2006).The activities of DGs OGG1, NTH1 and uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG) in brain mitochondria decrease significantly with age (Gredilla et al., 2010).",
      "\t\n\nPrevious evidence for an age-related decline in DNA repair was obtained largely from cell culture systems.For example, decreased repair has been observed in some but not all cases in mammalian cells undergoing senescence in culture [58,59], as well as cultures of primary cells taken from older versus younger individuals [26,[60][61][62][63][64].Additionally, there is a general correlation between mammalian lifespan and DNA repair (for review [65]).Further support for a relationship between DNA repair and aging comes from the existence of several human diseases caused by DNA repair defects that result in shortened lifespan in affected humans as well as rodent models, despite the much shorter normal rodent lifespan [24,25,66,67].Finally, a recent study reported that the in vivo repair of CPDs is decreased in the skin of old compared with that of young men, suggesting that the previous cell culture results are reflective of in vivo biology [27].",
      "\tDSB REPAIR AND THE DNA DAMAGE RESPONSE\n\nThe DNA damage response (DDR) to DSBs is particularly wellunderstood.As the presence of a DSB poses a major obstacle for further cell division a sophisticated network of DDR signaling is ignited (Ciccia and Elledge, 2010).Genetic experiments that were performed in yeast nearly 25 years ago established that DNA damage checkpoints transiently halt cell cycle progression in the presence of genotoxic stress to assure that the repair is completed before cell division (Weinert and Hartwell, 1989;Rowley et al., 1992).The recognition that DDR defects are causal for cancer development has sparked major research efforts employing model systems from yeast to mammals.The DNA damage checkpoint mechanisms turned out to be highly conserved throughout evolution.Multicellular organisms, however, not only respond by transient cell cycle arrest but also by inducing cellular senescence, thus permanently withdrawing from cell division, and apoptosis, through which damaged cells commit suicide to no longer pose a threat to the organism (Harper and Elledge, 2007).Intriguingly, the DDR not only impacts on regulators of cellular proliferation and cell death but impinges on a variety of cellular processes such as transcription, DNA repair, respiration, energy metabolism, chromatin remodeling, and others (Figure 1; Jackson and Bartek, 2009).",
      "\t\n\nreproductive maturity, we expect this peak to also trigger damage response pathways.Indeed, genes involved in DNA damage response are enriched in group 6 only (20/68 age-related genes, odd's ratio = 3.2; HT, P < 0.001).One of these genes, REV1, a deoxycytidyl transferase involved in DNA repair (Lin et al. 1999), is down-regulated by miR-222 during development and up-regulated during aging (Fig. 6C).Thus, DNA damage response genes might be actively up-regulated in aging to curb further accumulation of oxidative damage.The reason for down-regulation of damage repair pathways in the developmental period, however, is less clear.",
      "\t\n\nDNA damage response.DDR signaling consists of three components: DNA damage sensors, signal transducers, and protein effectors.ATM is a very early signal transducer, particularly in response to DSBs, whereas a related protein, ATR, is the signal transducer for replication stress.These kinases initiate events that affect DNA metabolism, cell cycle, and cell fate decisions.Short or damaged telomeres (100) and persistent unrepaired DNA damage (90) lead to the accumulation of numerous ATM and ATR effectors at the sites of damage, creating TIFs or DNA-SCARs (DNA segments with chromatin alterations reinforcing senescence), which are a hallmark of senescent cells.The proteins are activated by phosphorylation and modulate local chromatin structure and facilitate DNA repair (101).In a similar fashion, activation of oncogenes, such as RAS or RAF, triggers DNA replication origin firing, leading to the accumulation of incomplete replication intermediates and DSBs, robust activation of the DDR, and accumulation of DNA damage foci (102).Initially, dysfunctional telomeres were thought to drive human cell senescence, and damage at nontelomeric DNA was thought to drive senescence in organisms with longer telomeres, like mice.However, senescent cells from mice and men have damage foci in both regions of the genome, suggesting that both contribute to establishing and maintaining a senescent state.\tDNA Damage Drives Cells to Senescence\n\nCellular senescence was first described 50 years ago by Leonard Hayflick and Paul Moorhead (79, 80) as a state of irreversible cell cycle arrest limiting the number of cell divisions (Hayflick limit).Senescent cells are viable but fail to proliferate despite access to nutrients and growth factors.Later, telomeres were found to shorten with every cell division, and it became clear that critically short telomeres activate the DDR and the creation of telomere dysfunction-induced foci (TIFs).It is now apparent that multiple stressors, including mitochondrial dysfunction (SOD2 deficiency, inhibition of complex I, or by SIRT3 knockdown), oxidative stress, strong mitotic signals (oncogene expression or loss of a tumor suppressor), and genotoxic stress also drive cells to senescence.Genetic attenuation of the DDR enables reversal of cellular senescence (81).In contrast, introduction of DSBs in mouse liver, using a tetracycline-inducible SacI restriction endonuclease system, increases the burden of senescent cells in vivo and triggers hallmarks of liver aging (82), illustrating a clear path for how DNA damage can play a causal role in aging.",
      "\t\n\nThe DNA damage response (DDR) mediates repair as well as cellular arrest or apoptosis in response to endogenous and exogenous damage (Jackson and Bartek, 2009).In meiosis, the DDR also induces recombination via the formation of hundreds of double-strand breaks (Keeney et al., 2014).Most DNA damage repair genes appear to be important for culling oocytes (or spermatocytes) in response to persistent damage (Bolcun-Filas et al., 2014).Mutants that result in damage that does not trigger arrest, such as recombination intermediates (Hwang et al., 2017), could contribute to aneuploidy in affected human oocytes.",
      "\t\n\nAlthough defects in cellular responses to replication stress mediated by RecQ helicases, DNA repair enzymes and checkpoints have been implicated in accelerated aging by the premature aging phenotypes associated with these defects, replication stress that arises downstream of growth signaling has not been broadly considered as a factor contributing to normal aging.In this article, we review recently published evidence that suggests DNA replication stress is an important contributor to normal aging and age-dependent genome instability in all eukaryotes.We hypothesize that replication stress induced downstream of growth signaling by reactive oxygen produced in mitochondria underlies some of the agedependent genome instability attributed to oxidative damage to DNA.\t\n\nThe tighter G1 arrest promoted by caloric restriction and mutations that downregulate growth-signaling pathways-which were previously shown to induce oxidative stress responses-likely extends chronological life span in part by protecting against replication stress.A role for replication stress in chronological aging of budding yeast is consistent with the recent finding that a distinct subpopulation of nutrient-depleted cells-which includes all the cells that remain budded after growth arrest has occurred-expresses a number of genes encoding proteins required for the resolution of stalled replication forks (33).It could also explain the shorter replicative life span of chronologically aged cells when nutrients are subsequently restored (23).The accumulation of replication stress and replication stress-induced DNA damage during chronological aging would be expected to shorten the subsequent replicative life span of these cells, which (as discussed above) is also impacted by replication stress.\t\n\nThe discoveries of oncogene-induced replication stress and replication stress-induced senescence have important implications for understanding aging, in addition to understanding the etiology of cancer.First, these findings establish that, as in budding yeast, growth signaling implicated in aging can cause replication stress-induced DNA damage and genome instability in higher eukaryotes, in addition to inhibitory effects on oxidative and other stress responses.Second, the induction of DNA damage, cellular senescence and apoptosis by replication stress points to a specific mechanism by which replication stress associated with growth signaling might impact aging in mammals and other higher eukaryotes.Senescent cells increase in number with age, and increased senescence mediated by p53 and/or p16 ink4a has been implicated in a number of age-related pathologies (45,47).In fact, another remarkable (and unexpected) recent discovery in the cancer research arena is the premature aging phenotype of mice expressing a hyperactive form of p53, despite its inhibitory effects on tumorigenesis (47).Most likely, senescence and/or apoptosis mediated by p53 and p16 ink4a promote aging by reducing the proliferative capacity or number of stem cells or their proliferating progeny, leading to the decline in capacity for tissue renewal that underlies many aging phenotypes (47,48).Senescent cells may also contribute to aging by secreting substances capable of altering the tissue microenvironment (49).",
      "\t\n\nGenomics and proteomics studies have identified many additional DDR components, i.e., hundreds of proteins with activity changes following DNA damage (e.g., by phosphorylation), and dozens of transcription factors and microRNAs that alter the expression of hundreds to thousands of genes (105).Persistent damage signaling because of unrepaired damage could therefore alter the activity of many cellular processes for prolonged periods.Several denominators of aging are among the processes that are controlled by the DDR and therefore aggravate the impact of DNA damage on aging.Interestingly, analysis of transcription profiles of both naturally aging and rapidly aging DNA repair-deficient mouse mutants revealed two main constituents.Besides aging pathology-related expression changes, defects in transcription-coupled repair also alter nutrient sensing, energy metabolism, redox status, and intercellular communication pathways (W.P. Vermeij, P.G.Mastroberardino, J. Pothof & J.H.J. Hoeijmakers, unpublished results) (55,85,87,104,106).This complex response to persistent DNA damage encompasses the main energy metabolic pathways (mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis, and the pentose phosphate shunt, which delivers reducing equivalents for the redox state of the cell) as well as suppression of the somatotroph, lactotrophic, and thyrotrophic axes, which determine nutrient, mTOR, and insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling and promote longevity.This response was interpreted as a redirection of energy resources from growth to maintenance, and it could explain the prominent early cessation of growth, which is a hallmark of many progeroid syndromes and corresponding mouse models (87).Although regulation of these pathways is necessary during transient episodes of DNA damage and a variety of other stresses, chronic activation of the DDR owing to persistent DNA lesions might contribute to aging via permanently altered expression of important life span-determining pathways.\tPERSISTENT DAMAGE SIGNALING CONTROLS THE HALLMARKS OF AGING\n\nIn addition to stochastic changes in gene expression on a cell-to-cell basis, genotoxic stress also evokes a very complex DDR, which includes repair systems and elaborate damage checkpointsignaling pathways that halt cell proliferation to grant the cell time to repair.The main role of the DDR is to permit rapid, preferably error-free repair and to restore normal cell function.However, some DNA lesions are difficult to repair, which leads to persistent DDR signaling (62).For instance, DSBs with ends too far apart and eroded telomeres trigger persistent H2AX foci, which attracts numerous DSB repair and cell cycle control factors in a (futile) attempt to repair the lesion (102).These foci drive cellular senescence, a state of permanent cell cycle arrest (103).If accumulation of persistent DNA damage during aging induces a specific gene expression program, the latter is expected to be detectable in aged tissues.Indeed, transcription-blocking lesions, both in vitro and in vivo, have been shown to induce distinct gene expression changes that are highly similar to naturally aged organs (55,60,104).These observations provide evidence that persistent DNA damage signaling is present in progeria syndromes and also during natural aging.",
      "\t\n\nFigure 2. DNA damage responses in tumor suppression and aging.DNA damage responses, such as the activity of the tumor suppressors p53 and p16 Ink4a /p19 ARF , can have beneficial effects on health span when their activity suppresses tumorigenesis[68,69,71].However, when their effect on cell death and senescence leads to stem cell loss and tissue degeneration, they might contribute to aging[66,67]."
