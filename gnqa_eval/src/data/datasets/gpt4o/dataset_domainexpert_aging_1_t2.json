    "Recent single-cell transcriptomics studies provide a more detailed view of the aging process at the cellular level. They allow for the identification of age-related changes in gene expression, accumulation of genetic errors, and increased transcriptional noise in specific cell populations. This technology also helps in distinguishing changes arising from cell-intrinsic differences in transcriptional states from those reflecting changes in the proportion of subpopulations. Furthermore, it aids in understanding the influence of cell identity and tissue environment on the trajectory and magnitude of aging.",
    "Recent findings suggest that senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors play a significant role in age-related tissue dysfunction. Senescent cells secrete a mix of inflammatory and stromal regulators, which can negatively impact neighboring cells and the surrounding extracellular matrix, leading to chronic inflammation and vulnerable tissue. This can accelerate deterioration and hyperplasia in aging. Additionally, SASP factors such as IL-6, IL-1, IL-8, and TNF- have been linked to p53-mediated senescence in human vascular cells. The SASP is also known to reinforce cell cycle arrest and activate immune cell surveillance of senescent cells. However, the accumulation and chronic persistence of senescent cells can promote deleterious effects, suggesting a need for strategies to prevent or remove senescent cells to slow or stop aging and related pathologies.",
    "Age-related changes in chromatin architecture, such as the closing of chromatin in gene-rich regions and the relaxation of heterochromatin in gene-poor regions, can lead to a decrease in global gene expression and an increase in transcription of repetitive elements. This can result in a loss of cellular function. Additionally, key architectural chromatin proteins can be lost in aged cells, leading to structural defects in chromatin. This can make the genome more susceptible to DNA damage. Furthermore, the loss of heterochromatin that accompanies aging can lead to changes in global nuclear architecture and gene expression, contributing to aging and cellular senescence.",
    "Studies have shown that our lifespan is largely determined by epigenetic factors rather than being genetically predetermined. Epigenetic reprogramming can reverse or inhibit senescence, potentially prolonging a healthy life expectancy. This reprogramming can rejuvenate cells undergoing senescence or cells derived from very aged patients. Additionally, diet and other environmental factors can influence lifespan by changing the epigenetic information. The reversible nature of epigenetic modifications opens new avenues for therapeutic interventions in aging and age-associated diseases.",
    "Alterations in the mitochondrial genome, such as the accumulation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations and the reduction of mtDNA copy number, disrupt mitochondrial energetics. This disruption can lead to a decline in bioenergetic capacity in tissues, contributing to age-associated diseases and general senescence. The accumulation of these mutations often occurs in sites that encode structural subunits of the electron transport chain, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. Additionally, the decrease in mtDNA copy number has been reported in aged populations, which can further impact mitochondrial function and energy production. Therefore, these alterations in the mitochondrial genome and bioenergetics are significant contributors to the aging process in humans."

      "\t\n\nGenome-wide RNA-seq studies have shown that different tissues vary in age-related signatures, highlighting the importance of analyzing each tissue individually in each species [42,60].Reproductive tissues are unique in that they are a mix of interacting somatic and germline tissue.While the germline is widely recognized as being more resistant to aging than somatic cells, some age-related changes are known to occur.Critically, the relative contribution of factors intrinsic versus extrinsic to the germ line in reproductive decline remains poorly understood.",
      "\t\n\nOne of the challenges in identifying mechanisms that could drive age-related changes in gene expression is the cellular heterogeneity present in many aging gene expression studies [98].Previous studies of gene expression in Drosophila heads using microarrays compared ages ranging from day 1 to 80 [111,116,117]; recently, ageregulated genes were also identified in heads using RNA-seq [112,118].A comparison of our data with the 2914 age-regulated genes identified in the most recent RNA-seq study showed an overlap of only 348 of our 555 age-regulated genes [112].These data suggest that our cell-type specific approach identifies a subset of age-regulated genes that are masked by the cellular heterogeneity present in whole heads.However, the differences in the age-regulated genes identified might also reflect the inherent difficulty in comparing the nuclear and cytoplasmic transcriptomes.Since the nuclear enrichment strategy used in our approach biases the data towards genes that are actively transcribed, ageassociated changes in the storage pool of cytoplasmic mRNAs available for translation are not reflected in our current photoreceptor data.However, we note that our qPCR analysis of individual age-regulated genes in dissected eyes largely mirrored the results from photoreceptor nuclei.Complementary cell type-specific data on the ribosome-bound pool of mRNAs destined for translation could be obtained using the translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) technique, based on cell-specific expression of an EGFP-tagged ribosomal subunit [119,120].",
      "\t\n\nWhile the precise mechanisms and connections between several epigenetic changes and human pathologies are still poorly understood, state-of-the-art next generation sequencing methods will allow researchers to address remaining questions.For instance, chromatin accessibility using Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) can be coupled to ChIP-seq as well as gene expression studies (mRNA-seq) using bulk mRNA or even analyzing single cells (scRNA-seq).In addition, advances in molecular biology and cell culture approaches (for instance Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9) will be beneficial in clarifying aging-processes across species.",
      "\t\n\nThe study of senescence underscores the need to map how the 3D dynamics of chromatin structure is affected by changes in the cellular transcriptome, and vice versa.Coupling the new singlenuclei imaging tools with spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomics methods will open new channels for linking the dynamic aspects of chromatin structure to transcriptional changes [88].In addition, identifying the biophysical principles that govern these dynamic changes in structure will give us a handle of the upstream mechanisms that control chromatin dynamics and their concurrent epigenetic changes during senescence entry and exit.New analytical methods allow one to assess the dynamic and (bio) physical properties of chromatin as it undergoes structural changes and to couple this with transcriptional states [71][72][73].This will reveal the causal relationship between inducors [89] and the genome (re-)organization that accompany transcriptional control.Understanding senescence on this level has the added value of allowing one to develop markers relevant for disease diagnostics and therapeutic intervention.",

      "\t\n\nBecause aging is characterized by the progressive dysfunction of most organs, single-cell sequencing has been recently used to study the accumulation of somatic mutations in unique cell populations of a specific organ.The analysis of the singlecell transcriptome of 2544 unique human pancreas cells of 8 donors (compassing 60 years frame) showed that islet endocrine cells from old people tend to increase its transcriptional noise and to accumulate genetic errors.Transcriptional noise was observed by an increase in non-cell-type-specific gene expression in these cells and is not caused by the mutational load.This suggests that aging is characterized by a gradual accumulation of epigenetic and genetic errors in independent events and in stochastic manner [84].Interestingly, the transcriptome of single-islet pancreatic cells in young (3 months) and old (26 months) mice showed that only 193 transcripts changed their expression in an age-related way, with no obvious deleterious effect in pancreas physiology [85].Moreover, the transcriptome of neuronal cell clusters of D. melanogaster brains showed that these cells experienced an exponential decrease in RNA content during aging that does not affect the neuronal identity [86].\tTranscriptome Deregulation in Aging\n\nThe universe of transcripts in a cell or tissue at a precise time and metabolic conditions is highly variable and dynamic.Since aging is a continuous process, the set of genes that are differentially expressed between young and old cells is highly heterogeneous and depends, among other factors, on the individual's genetic background and life history, making it difficult to analyze or predict.Nevertheless, the study of the transcriptome has brought to light important information that helps us understand the mechanisms that underlie the aging process.",
      "\t\n\nAccumulating evidence across experimental models of aging suggests that complex underlying molecular factors are important during aging, many of which are still poorly understood.Changes in traditional gene expression features such as general transcription levels (Lai et al., 2019), epigenetic regulation (Booth and Brunet, 2016;Pal and Tyler, 2016;Sen et al., 2016) and alternative splicing (Bhadra et al., 2020) are reviewed elsewhere.In this Review, we focus on three emerging factors of interest: transposable elements, circular RNAs (circRNAs) and the mitochondrial transcriptome.The analysis of the first two factors can be readily incorporated into existing data analysis pipelines and may provide important insights into the aging process.We provide an introduction to these emerging factors, highlight known relationships and current gaps in knowledge with respect to aging and, when available, indicate tools that are available for their analysis.In the future, a more systematic incorporation of these factors into aging studies will help provide a more comprehensive view of the changes that occur, suggest novel molecular mechanisms underlying aspects of aging, and provide new therapeutic targets for pro-longevity interventions.",
      "\t\n\nWhile these publications all focus on mouse as a model, the unbiased nature of single-cell RNA sequencing provides great discovery potential in less-wellstudied animals.An example of this is the profiling of platelets (thrombocytes) from hematopoietic stem cells in zebrafish by Macaulay et al.

      "\tConclusions\n\nTaken together, our present work, and previous work by others [14,15], shows how RNA sequencing at high depth can address basic questions as to the molecular basis of mammalian aging.We showed that aging is unlikely to be accompanied by a significant loss of tissue-specific gene expression profiles; we did not find evidence for gene de-repression or a stochastic increase of the fraction of the genome that is transcribed.Yet, our data uncovered extensive changes in gene expression patterns, which are subject to stochastic variation as indicated by a significant increase in individual variation.We also demonstrated that the increased accuracy of RNA-seq enable us to better capture major aging phenotypes at the transcriptional level, thereby unmasking important molecular mechanisms underlying aging and its related disease sequelae.\t\n\nWhile changes in gene expression profiles have been used as biomarkers for aging and sometimes even as predictors of biological aging rate [8], the ultimate aim in studying the aging transcriptome is to elucidate the pathways that define age-related degenerative processes and the responses they evoke, in a tissue-specific manner.For this purpose it is essential to collect mRNA expression data in the context of their non-mRNA, gene regulatory RNAs.Indeed, as mentioned, apart from the canonical protein-coding mRNAs, which make up about 3 % of the genome, the critical role of a multitude of ncRNAs are now well recognized.NcRNA is a broad umbrella term that includes pseudogenes, or those genes that have lost their protein-coding potential but are sometimes still capable of being transcribed [11], long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), typically >200 nucleotides long, which have been shown to perform a wide range of functions from transcriptional de-repression to silencing [12], and small ncRNAs (<200 nucleotides in length), which are mainly comprise the regulatory microRNAs (miRNAs), small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), and transfer RNAs (tRNAs).Although species in this last category are small, they may have a large impact on cellular function, regulating such processes as gene silencing, splicing, and translation [13].The role of ncRNAs in aging remains unclear, which essentially constrains attempts to generate comprehensive functional networks of tissuespecific alterations in the RNA landscape.",
      "\t\n\nHow cell-type-specific gene expression programs change during organismal life span has long been debated (5,6), and what cell-to-cell transcriptome-wide differences accumulate during aging are relatively unexplored (16).By activating nave CD4 + T cells and quantifying the transcriptional responses of hundreds of single cells using scRNAseq, we confirmed that translation processes and immune response genes are rapidly up-regulated (11) and discovered a reduction in cell-to-cell variability across thousands of transcripts.Thus, immune activation rapidly reduces transcriptional heterogeneity across the population of CD4 + T cells, revealing a regulatory strategy comparable to induced pluripotent stem cell reprogramming (18,19).",
      "\t\n\nIn addition to exploring whether histone loss is a feature of in vivo aging in higher organisms, future studies may be directed to reveal ''pockets'' of histone loss in the genome.This requires advanced single-cell genomic analyses to acquire sufficient sequencing depth in a population of cells.Elucidating the signaling pathway(s) triggering histone loss will be a key concep-tual advance.An additional area of future investigation is characterizing the alternative pool of canonical histones synthesized exclusively in senescence.These are formed via alternative splicing events from histone genes with two exons that eliminate the stem-loop terminator but allow polyadenylation for stabilization in non-proliferating cells.These alternative histones are then incorporated in the genome by replication independent chaperones to create a dynamic chromatin state (Rai et al., 2014), the further study of which may reveal key epigenetic differences between replicative and non-replicative states.",
      "\t\n\nNew advances in single cell genomics (Wills et al. 2013), especially single cell RNA-seq (Hashimshony et al. 2012;Ramskold et al. 2012), have opened the way to characterize distinct functional states of individual cells, even within seemingly homogeneous immune cell populations (Shalek et al. 2013;Mahata et al. 2014;Shalek et al. 2014).These should allow us to distinguish changes that arise from cellintrinsic differences in transcriptional states from those that reflect changes in the proportion of subpopulations.Furthermore, single cell analysis should allow us to relate prospective profiles of HSCs that have just been isolated with known heterogeneity in their retrospective functional capacity in transplantation assays.",

      "\t\n\nThe relationship between CS and longevity was highlighted across various sections of this manuscript.The inducers of senescence were significantly overrepresented in the anti-longevity human orthologues, while the inhibitors of senescence were even more overrepresented in the pro-longevity human orthologues (Additional file 1: Table S7) [34].Furthermore, both the CellAge regulators of CS and the overexpressed signatures of CS were significantly overrepresented in the overexpressed aging signatures from the human, rat, and mouse aging signature meta-analysis [42].Interestingly, we found that the overexpressed signatures of replicative CS overexpressed with age were significantly enriched for regulated exocytosis (including leukocyte activation), cell proliferation, and aging (Additional file 1: Table S10; Additional file 2: Fig. S3B).The SASP is a known inducer of chronic inflammation in aged tissue [12,13], and the enrichment of terms relating to leukocyte activation highlights the role CS plays in activating the immune system via inflammatory factors with age.One tissue that consistently showed different CS expression patterns with age was the uterus.This observations was already noted in a previous study which also observed that DEGs downregulated in cancer were upregulated with age and DEGs upregulated in cancer were downregulated with age in six tissues, but not in the uterus [32].\tBackground\n\nIn the 1960s, Leonard Hayflick and Paul Moorhead demonstrated that human fibroblasts reached a stable proliferative growth arrest between their fortieth and sixtieth divisions [1].Such cells would enter an altered state of \"replicative senescence,\" subsisting in a nonproliferating, metabolically active phase with a distinct vacuolated morphology [2].This intrinsic form of senescence is driven by gradual replicative telomere erosion, eventually exposing an uncapped free double-stranded chromosome end and triggering a permanent DNA damage response [3,4].Additionally, acute premature senescence can occur as an antagonistic consequence of genomic, epigenomic, or proteomic damage, driven by oncogenic factors, oxidative stress, or radiation [5].Initially considered an evolutionary response to reduce mutation accrual and subsequent tumorigenesis, the pleiotropic nature of senescence has also been positively implicated in processes including embryogenesis [6,7], wound healing [8], and immune clearance [9,10].By contrast, the gradual accumulation and chronic persistence of senescent cells with time promotes deleterious effects that are considered to accelerate deterioration and hyperplasia in aging [11].Senescent cells secrete a cocktail of inflammatory and stromal regulators-denoted as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype, or SASP-which adversely impact neighboring cells, the surrounding extracellular matrix, and other structural components, resulting in chronic inflammation, the induction of senescence in healthy cells, and vulnerable tissue [12,13].Mice expressing transgenic INK-ATTAC, which induces apoptosis of p16-positive senescent cells, also have increased lifespan and improved healthspan [14].It is, therefore, no surprise that in recent years gerontology has heavily focused on the prevention or removal of senescent cells as a means to slow or stop aging and related pathologies [15][16][17].",
      "\t\n\nThere is much evidence to suggest that certain mechanisms of aging are conserved across species, with similar pathways regulating life span and the progression of aging in worms, flies and mammals [67].This notion suggests that there may exist common features of aging that are evolutionarily conserved, which are reflected by agerelated patterns of gene expression that are shared among mammalian cell types within diverse tissues.The present study has identified robust age-related expression patterns that appear to be characteristic of cells within many or most mammalian tissues.It is not expected that all such age-related expression patterns will be associated with deleterious pathologies, since some modifications of gene expression with age are likely to reflect favorable compensatory mechanisms.Nevertheless, some age-regulated genes identified in this analysis are known to modulate inflammatory processes and contribute to cellular proliferation.For instance, two widespread effects of aging were up regulation of granulin (Grn) and secreted phosphoprotein 1 (Spp1) (see Figure 5).Increased expression of Grn was in fact the most widespread effect of aging identified, occurring in nearly all of the tissues examined (16 of 22).Grn encodes the granulin protein (also referred to as progranulin, granulin-epithelin precursor, proepithelin or acrogranin), which can inhibit TNF-induced inflammatory processes and promote vascularization necessary for wound and tissue repair [68], but can also give rise to cleavage products that stimulate cytokine secretion leading to the exacerbation of inflammatory processes [69].Additionally, granulin has been identified as potent growth factor that stimulates aggressive cell proliferation, and in at least some cell lines, this mitogenic effect depends upon the expression level of Grn [70].Increased expression of Spp1 with age was identified in 14 of 22 mouse tissue types, with the strongest increase observed in the cerebellum.Spp1 encodes osteopontin, a protein involved in localized recruitment of macrophages and in the production of cytokines within certain immune cells, which can contribute to a state of chronic inflammation [71].Osteopontin is also a regulator of tumor progression and its abundance within tumors has emerged as an impressive biomarker for numerous types of cancer [72].Expression of osteopontin within tissues and in circulation has also been associated with a wide range of other conditions, including obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease [73][74][75].An important component of future work will be RT-PCR investigation of Grn and Spp1 expression patterns with age, both across mouse tissues and among different mouse strains [11].",
      "\t\n\nCellular senescence is a cell state of cell cycle arrest that can eliminate damaged cells and promote tissue remodeling.Cellular senescence is predominantly elicited in response to intrinsic and extrinsic stimulus, such as oncogene activation, stress, DNA damage, CDKN2A locus derepression, mitochondrial dysfunction (Hernandez-Segura et al., 2018).Unfortunately, compelling evidence has suggested that cellular senescence is implicated in pathological status, in which senescenceassociated secretory phenotype (SASP) affects the clearance of senescent cells and further results the decline of tissue function (Muoz-Espn and Serrano, 2014), and secret pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8, chemokines and growth factors, which contributes to tumorigenesis in aged organisms (Herranz and Gil, 2018).Cellular senescence has been studied in various cancer types and compelling evidences have revealed that cellular senescence is associated with cancer prognosis (Dai et al., 2022a;Domen et al., 2022a;Domen et al., 2022b).Development of senescence-related classification and characterization of senescence-based signature have attracted much attention in tumor research (Feng et al., 2022a;Hong et al., 2022).However, the mechanisms of cellular senescence in COAD, as well as the specific prognostic signatures are poorly understood.Therefore, this study identified senescence-based subtypes based on scRNA-seq and shed novel insights into potential roles of cellular senescence in COAD heterogeneity.We further constructed a prognostic risk model in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-COAD, which offered a novel approach to predict clinical outcomes in patients with COAD.",
      "\tDissecting the Role of Cellular Senescence\n\nAnother hallmark of the ageing process is the induction and accumulation of cells in a senescent state [2].Cellular senescence is characterised by a stable arrest of the cell cycle while maintaining viability and metabolic activity.Senescent cells are also known to activate what is known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which is a plethora of secreted factors comprising pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and matrix remodelling enzymes [88,89].Beyond telomere attrition in the case of replicative senescence, cellular senescence can be induced by many other cellular stresses like oncogene activation, loss of tumour suppressors, oxidative stress, persistent DNA damage response, ionising radiation and cytotoxic chemicals [88,89].Cellular senescence is thought to primarily act as a potent cell-autonomous tumour-suppressive mechanism by preventing the expansion of pre-malignant cells.However, research over the past decade has revealed that cellular senescence is a pleiotropic phenotype that has many context-dependent paracrine effects mediated by the SASP, such as aiding in tissue regeneration or, paradoxically, promoting tumorigenesis and the acquisition of malignancy [88][89][90].\tThe Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP)\n\nSASP is one of the most representative features of senescent cells and may explain the organismal expression of aging and age-related diseases.Senescent cells produce a deleterious microenvironment through the production and secretion of proliferative and proinflammatory molecules such as IL-1 and -1, IL-6, IL-8, the chemotactic cytokine GRO, IGBP-7, growth factors, VEGF, TGF-, serine proteases, and matrix remodeling enzymes [146].It has been determined that the activation of the RAS oncogene and loss of p53 function markedly amplify and accelerate SASP development in senescent human fibroblasts [147].\t\n\nA variety of noncoding RNAs are involved in the regulation of the senescenceassociated secretory phenotype (SASP), including miR-15b, miR-187, miR-9, miR-222, miR-34a, miR-125b, miR152, and miR-199a, which participate in regulating mRNA turnover and translation, whereas miR-146a, miR-335, and miR-21 are associated with factor secretion [69].Interestingly, a number of miRNAs associated with inflammation and aging (inflammaging) have been found in exosomes [70].Additionally, several mRNAs responsible for the expression of SASP mediators are regulated by lncRNAs, such as lncRNA-LET, LincRNA-Cox2, NEAT1, lnc-IL7R, Lethe, and THRIL, most of which regulate interleukin-related genes [69].\t\n\nIn contrast, proliferative cells undergo cellular senescence, which is characterized by permanent cell cycle arrest and a hyperfunctional phenotype that is associated with the overproduction and secretion of growth factors, proteases, and inflammatory mediators.This particular phenotype is termed the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP).Replicative cellular aging includes biochemical, morphological, and functional modifications that lead to the irreversible impairment of cell proliferation associated with DNA damage, shortening of the telomeres, and changes in chromatin architecture, as previously described [135,136].",

      "\t\n\nSeveral representative applications merit an integrative genomics approach to aging.One application is to determine which molecular and cellular factors responsible for the process of cellular senescence also underlie functional cognitive decline.Cellular senescence is an anticancer and wound healing mechanism characterized by arrested cellular proliferation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and proteases (the senescence associated secretory phenotype, or SASP).Senescent cells accumulate with age in many tissues, where the SASP promotes chronic inflammation and exacerbates age-associated degeneration and hyperplasia.Recent evidence suggests that neurological aging and neurodegeneration are accompanied by an accumulation of secretory cells in brain, suggesting that cellular senescence may contribute to brain aging [2] through a shared mechanism.Overlapping mechanisms can be detected using functional genomics studies of both the biology of cellular senescence and cognitive aging.",
      "\t\n\nMarkers of senescence are detected at higher levels in tissues of older mice, humans, and other primates, including skin, liver, pancreatic islets, bone marrow, intestine, kidney, ovary, heart, and retina tissues.Senescent cells have altered metabolism (83).They also secrete proinflammatory factors and proteases able to alter the local tissue environment (84), providing plausible mechanisms by which senescent cells could promote aging and age-related degenerative diseases.Indeed, senescent cells are found at sites of numerous tissue-specific, age-related diseases, including atherosclerosis, osteoarthritis, sarcopenia, ulcer formation, cancer, and Alzheimer disease, which is suggestive of a causative role.However, the most convincing evidence that senescent cells cause aging comes from recent genetic (85) and pharmacologic studies (86) revealing that clearance of senescent cells can prevent or delay tissue dysfunction and extend health span.",
      "\t\n\nInteresting from a molecular biological point of view is the work of Smith and Pereira-Smith (1989), who demonstrated in a series of elegant studies that senescent fibroblasts contain a protein factor capable of suppressing the replicative capacity of early-passage cells.These results point to an active rather than a passive mechanism of aging, which could be based on a genetic program.It should be noted, however, that the replicative capacity of cells in an adult organism covers a spectrum ranging from fixed postmitotic to continuously replicating cells.The precise relationship between replicative loss and differentiation is not yet fully understood and the interface between development, differentiation, and aging is still diffuse.Therefore, the loss of the replicative capacity of cells in vitro cannot be easily extrapolated to organismal senescence.",
      "\tAltered Transcriptional Programs\n\nThe most obvious molecular consequence of age is an altered transcriptional program, a phenomenon that has been best studied in senescent human cells.In addition to upregulating alternative histone transcripts (Rai et al., 2014), senescent cells remodel the epigenetic landscape to induce a subset of cellular defense and inflammatory response genes, many of which are secreted from the cell and are characterized as part of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) (Coppe t al., 2008).SASP has been theorized to promote immune clearance of pre-malignant senescent cells to facilitate tumor suppression; however, chronic SASP induction is also believed to promote tissue aging, underscoring the delicate balance between the ''benefits'' and ''consequences'' of senescence (Adams, 2009).\t\n\nA strong epigenetic correlation was shown between loss of H3K27me3 and upregulation of SASP genes in senescent cells (Shah et al., 2013).Additionally, inhibition of the H3K4 methyltransferase MLL1 was shown to reduce SASP indirectly, via repression of pro-proliferative cell-cycle genes and DNA damage response genes that in turn reduce SASP (Capell et al., 2016).Taken together, these lines of evidence indicate that transcriptional reprogramming in senescence occurs through altered activity of specific epigenetic proteins.Mimicking these trends, HSCs isolated from old mice show an upregulated inflammatory response and downregulated chromatin remodeling, DNA repair, and transcriptional repression compared to young controls.These changes are concomitant with the inability of the older HSCs to rejuvenate the vascular system (Chambers et al., 2007).RNAseq analyses of highly purified HSC populations showed upregulated gene ontology (GO) categories related to cell proliferation, cell adhesion, and ribosomal protein (RP) genes while those related to cell cycle, DNA base excision repair, and DNA replication were downregulated.Pathway analyses revealed that TGFb signaling is reduced in aging HSCs, which could explain a myeloid bias that is established with age (Sun et al., 2014).",
      "\t\n\nIrreparably damaged cells may also enter senescence.Senescence occurs in response to various insults, including genotoxic (e.g., oxidative) stress, telomere erosion, and oncogenic and replicative stress, which often occur as a result of persistent DNA lesions (111).Cellular senescence is elevated in many accelerated-aging mouse models and in a plethora of human age-associated pathologies, including osteoporosis, atherosclerosis, glomerular disease, diabetic venous ulcers, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and emphysema, osteoarthritis, herniated intervertebral discs, and vascular calcification (112).Senescent cells are resistant to apoptosis and accumulate exponentially with age as a consequence of inefficient clearance.Unlike apoptotic tissues, senescent tissues largely retain their function.Therefore, senescence is thought to be antagonistically pleiotropic: It is beneficial early in life during development and later in life during wound healing after injury, but it becomes deleterious late in life, as the tissue increasingly accumulates nondividing senescent cells, which disturb the tissue microenvironment (113).This disruption is primarily caused by the secretion of a range of proinflammatory cyto-and chemokines, a state that has been defined as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) (103).Major SASP factors include IL1, IL6, IL8, and various matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), all of which individually are thought to drive aging and age-related diseases.Thus, DNA damage is a major determinant in controlling cell death, stem cell exhaustion, and cellular senescence, which are considered important events in the development of age-related pathology and aging.",
      "\t\n\nIn vitro senescent cells are characterized by a pro-inflammatory, pro-oxidative senescence-associated phenotype (SASP) [144].The release of inflammatory mediators and ROS production likely reinforces cell cycle arrest in an autocrine fashion and activates immune cell surveillance of senescent cells [144,162].The SASP occurs within a few days of senescence induction in cells and appears to be irreversible due to stable chromatin modifications around clusters of SASP genes [163][164][165].The SASP profile in vascular endothelial cells from humans and rodents has been characterized by in vitro studies using comprehensive arrays of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines [144,[165][166][167][168][169].The release of IL-6, IL-1, IL-8, TNF-, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) has been linked to p53-mediated senescence in human vascular cells in vitro [170,171].Interestingly, P16/pRB-induced senescence has not been shown to lead to a SASP in human cells [144,164].Additionally, human arterial endothelial cells that had undergone replicative senescence in vitro exhibited elevated levels of H 2 O 2 and O 2 -as well as reductions in NO [172,173].This SASP profile is possibly due to mitochondrial uncoupling or alterations in eNOS [172,174].Several lines of evidence support a major role for NFB in the induction and maintenance of the p53-mediated SASP in human and rodent cells [175][176][177].Indeed, inhibition of NFB allowed cells to escape p53-mediatedsenescence and reduced oxidative stress in rodents [175,177].This alludes to the importance of the SASP in reinforcing p53-mediated senescence and the importance of NFB in promoting the SASP.Additionally, p53 activation leads to a shift from glycolytic to oxidative phosphorylation energy metabolism [178], which could result in increased flux through the electron transport chain and ROS release from mitochondria.Taken together endothelial cell senescence could be cause or consequence of the age-related increase in oxidative stress and likely contributes to the spread of vascular inflammation via the SASP, from senescent cells (Figure 3).Lastly this chronic inflammation could persist and Genomic instability, or DNA damage acquired over time, is an important mechanism that may underlie the agerelated accumulation of senescent cells reported in arterial tissues [147,148].Age-related genomic instability in vascular cells can occur from a variety of genotoxic insults, including oxidative stress [179,180] and mechanical stress [181].DNA damage results in temporary cell cycle arrest to allow DNA repair pathways time to repair breaks prior to a cell entering S phase during replication [155].If damage is persistent or extensive, permanent cell cycle arrest or even apoptosis will ensue [155].Common forms of DNA damage relevant to aging include single and double strand DNA breaks and DNA adducts.While the age-related accumulation of DNA breaks and DNA adducts have not been shown in human vascular cells, DNA breaks have been shown to occur with advancing age in sperm cells [182] and the mitochondrial DNA of skeletal muscle [183,184].",
      "\t\n\nAlthough most changes are unique to tissues or cell types, we identified a shared core of differentially expressed genes with age.This core is characterized by decreased expression of genes involved in SRP-dependent protein translation and protein targeting to the ER and increased expression of genes involved in inflammation, consistent with previous observations in S. cerevisiae (Hendrickson et al. 2018) and multiple studies of aging tissues (Amador-Noguez et al. 2004;Rodwell et al. 2004;O'Brown et al. 2015;Benayoun et al. 2019).Observation of these changes across many cell identities and tissue environments suggests that they are consistent molecular players in the causal network of aging.However, functional studies modulating these pathways in multiple cell identities are necessary to establish causal links to other aging phenotypes.",
      "\tSenescence associated secretory phenotype factors overexpressed in LVAD derived cells\n\nCellular senescence is not limited to replicative arrest, as detrimental effects have been documented in vitro and in vivo upon intracellular regulation and the microenvironment surrounding senescent cells [7].Expression of Senescence Associated Secretory Phenotype factors (SASPs) [7] was surveyed in culture expanded cCICs to assess widespread changes consequential to biological age and pathology.Overexpression was characteristic in LVAD-derived cells for interleukins (IL6, IL1B), inflammatory factors (MIF) and growth factors and regulators (NRG1, FGF2, HGF, FGF7, VEGFA, ANG, CXCL12, IGFBP3, IGFBP4, IGFBP6 and IGFBP7), proteases (MMP1, TIMP2, PLAT and CTSB) and soluble receptors/ligands (ICAM1, ICAM3, TNFRSF11B, TNFRSF1A, FAS, IL6ST and EGFR) (Fig. 3a).Interestingly, SERPINE1 has been associated with coronary heart disease but was overexpressed in neonatal cells.Additional SASPs markers were evaluated showing mild to consistent upregulation on LVAD derived cells, with the exception of TGFB1 (SF5) [28].Pseudotime analysis using Monocle3 established the progression of cultured cells from distinct origins in clusters 8 and 9 (Figs.1d and 3b).Using expression of SASPs and ODC1 as a target critical for development [43], the transcriptional trajectory between neonatal and LVAD derived cells was defined, pseudotime abstract units were calculated, and directionality of the system was authenticated (Fig. 3b and c and SF6).LVAD derived cells positioned in the terminal leaves of the pseudotime plot consistent with the transcriptional profile of their aged origin.Further confirmation using expression of 39 genes generated SASP (26 genes), growth factor (18 genes), interleukin (6 genes), and receptor and ligands (9 genes) scores for each cell in our dataset (See Methods).Neonatal cells scored lower for growth factors, receptors and ligands and overall SASPs targets, while maintaining a similar score of interleukin expression (Fig. 3d).Beta galactosidase 1 (GLB1) was expressed in 0.28% of neonatal cCICs with to 0.5% LVAD derived cells expressing it.The increase observed in LVAD samples was consistent with the increase observed in senescence markers p16 and GLB1 previously reported by our group in cells comparably prepared [34].Overexpression of Fibroblast Growth Factor 2 (FGF2) and Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF) along with other secretory targets in LVAD cCICs is consistent with previous observations [35] (Fig. 3e).Collectively, these results support transcriptional imprinting in LVAD derived cells resulting from prolonged cellular stress in vivo prompts acquisition of a widespread senescent profile that is absent in neonatal cCICs.\t\n\nFig. 3.

      "\t\n\nIn conclusion, the nuclear changes that typify all forms of cellular senescence are lamin cleavage, increased nuclear envelope permeability, disruption of the transport between the nucleus and cytoplasm, and changes in gene expression, along with changes in chromatin packing and architecture.Using machine learning to evaluate the interdependence of such phenotypes may allow one to use chromatin features to define cellular senescence states.\t\nCellular senescence, a cell state characterized by growth arrest and insensitivity to growth stimulatory hormones, is accompanied by a massive change in chromatin organization.Senescence can be induced by a range of physiological signals and pathological stresses and was originally thought to be an irreversible state, implicated in normal development, wound healing, tumor suppression and aging.Recently cellular senescence was shown to be reversible in some cases, with exit being triggered by the modulation of the cell's transcriptional program by the four Yamanaka factors, the suppression of p53 or H3K9me3, PDK1, and/or depletion of AP-1.Coincident with senescence reversal are changes in chromatin organization, most notably the loss of senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF) found in oncogene-induced senescence.In addition to fixed-cell imaging, chromatin conformation capture and multi-omics have been used to examine chromatin reorganization at different spatial resolutions during senescence.They identify determinants of SAHF formation and other key features that differentiate distinct types of senescence.Not surprisingly, multiple factors, including the time of induction, the type of stress experienced, and the type of cell involved, influence the global reorganization of chromatin in senescence.Here we discuss how changes in the threedimensional organization of the genome contribute to the regulation of transcription at different stages of senescence.In particular, the distinct contributions of heterochromatin-and lamina-mediated interactions, changes in gene expression, and other cellular control mechanisms are discussed.We propose that high-resolution temporal and spatial analyses of the chromatin landscape during senescence will identify early markers of the different senescence states to help guide clinical diagnosis.\t\n\nIt is clear that chromatin reorganization is a major player in senescence, yet it is unclear which mechanisms trigger the changes that are crucial either at senescence entry or exit.Global changes in vary depending on the stressor used, the time of induction and the cell type.These differences that SAHF may also form through somewhat different mechanisms, depending on the stressor used.If so, it will be important to identify both the essential commonality underlying SAHF formation, and the stress-specific aspects.To this end, time-resolved, high resolution measurements of changes in 3D chromatin dynamics must be correlated with changes in transcriptional output during the induction of senescence by different stressors in single living cells [78][79][80][81].This would allow one to investigate both global and local changes in chromatin mobility over specific genomic regions (e.g., SAHF vs heterochromatin vs euchromatin).",
      "\t\n\nBoth physiological aging and premature aging syndromes reveal signs of extensive alteration of chromatin structure, followed by increased susceptibility to persistent DNA damage (132).Although several studies suggest that altered chromatin conformations occur with age (43,44), almost no direct connections established the involvement of ATP-dependent nucleosome remodelers until recently.The C. elegans homolog of the catalytic subunit of the NURD chromatin remodeling complex, LET-418/Mi2, has recently been identified as a longevitydetermining factor because let-418 deficiency leads to prolonged life span and increased environmental stress resistance.This phenotype is partially dependent on the transcription factor DAF-16/FOXO.Genetic interaction analysis further suggests that let-418 may serve as a life span determinant by acting through the germ cell loss pathway.This protein is highly evolutionarily conserved, and indeed, it has been found that these increased longevity and enhanced stress resistance functions are also conserved in fruit flies and plants (133).One study that aims to identify the molecular basis for the age-related defect in chromatin structure used cells from HGPS patients and noted that components of the NURD ATPdependent nucleosome remodeler complex, including RBBP4 and RBBP7, were substantially reduced in HGPS cells (132).Conversely, experimental depletion of RBBP4 and RBBP7 in cell culture caused an increase in endogenous DNA damage similar to what has been observed in HGPS cells and cells from aged individuals.Furthermore, it appeared likely that the defect in chromatin structure precedes the increased endogenous DNA damage observed under the experimental conditions, suggesting that the altered chromatin structure due to loss of NURD function leads to DNA damage or a defect in DNA repair.Loss of NURD subunits was evident not only in HGPS cells but also in cells collected from aged individuals.In summary, loss of NURD subunits seems to be an early event during both physiological and premature aging, which contributes to alterations in the chromatin structure, making the genome more susceptible to DNA damage (132).Although the exact mechanism behind the declining level of NURD components is yet to be determined, this study implicates the functional decline of an ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling complex in aging.\tTHE HETEROCHROMATIN LOSS MODEL OF AGING\n\nOne of the earlier proposed models of aging was the \"heterochromatin loss model of aging\" (26,27).This model suggests that the loss of heterochromatin that accompanies aging leads to changes in global nuclear architecture and the expression of genes residing in those regions, directly or indirectly causing aging and cellular senescence.As with any other model of aging, the heterochromatin loss model is supported by experimental data, but there are also confounding observations.Loss of transcriptional silencing due to decay of the heterochromatin occurs during aging in all eukaryotes examined from yeast to humans (26)(27)(28)(29)(30), and there is evidence that accelerating or reversing this process can either shorten or lengthen life span, respectively (Fig. 2).Gene silencing requires the absence of histone acetylation within heterochromatin regions.Accordingly, treatment with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors or deletion of genes encoding HDACs, such as yeast SIR2 or its sirtuin counterparts in metazoan species, shortens life span, whereas chemical activation or overexpression of SIR2 or sirtuins extends life span (31,32).Yeast Sir2 was first recognized as an H4 K16Ac deacetylase, whereas mammalian SIRT1 is an H3 K9Ac or H4 K16Ac deacetylase (32).However, it is now appreciated that sirtuins deacetylate not only histones but also many other transcriptional regulators, and indeed, their roles in aging extend far beyond heterochromatin, including genome maintenance (33).It has been previously observed in budding yeast that redistribution of Sir proteins from the silent mating-type loci to sites of increased genomic instability during aging causes loss of silencing from heterochromatic mating-type loci to cause sterility and promote aging (34).Similarly, the mammalian homolog of Sir2, SIRT1, has been shown to repress repetitive elements and other regions across the mouse genome.However, in response to DNA damage, SIRT1 is redistributed from these loci to DNA breaks, resulting in alterations in gene expression that is comparable to those in the aging mice brain (33).Therefore, repression of heterochromatic repeat elements seems to be evolutionarily conserved and extremely critical in life span maintenance (33,35).Another example where it is clear that loss of heterochromatin promotes aging is at the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) locus, where loss of silencing of the rDNA promotes genomic instability and aging in budding yeast (36,37).Further evidence supporting the heterochromatin loss theory comes from the analysis of chromatin structures from HGPS patients and, most recently, from a Werner syndrome stem cell model of premature aging (10,(38)(39)(40)(41).These disorders exemplify how deregulation of heterochromatin, illustrated by global loss of heterochromatin marks (discussed more below) and altered heterochromatin structure, accelerates aging.Although some of the defects observed in premature aging patients have also been observed in aged individuals (39), it is still debatable whether the findings are equally applicable to physiological aging.",

      "\t\n\nAged cells show several distinctive features on their chromatin (Figure 2).The CDKN2A (encoding cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16) locus becomes progressively expressed with age, eventually leading to cellular senescence, a state of irreversible cell-cycle arrest (Krishnamurthy et al., 2004).This mechanism may be particularly pronounced in adult tissue stem cells, which need to undergo long-term self-renewal, especially in the setting of tissue injury.The CDKN2A locus is under epigenetic control by the Polycomb group proteins, a gene-silencing complex.Polycomb-repressive complex 2 (PRC2, with EZH2 being the catalytic subunit) trimethylates lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3), which then recruits PRC1 to further modify the chromatin to enforce gene silencing (Margueron and Reinberg, 2011).PRC2 occupies the CDKN2A locus in young cells and prevents p16 expression.As pancreatic b cells age, EZH2 mRNA and protein levels decline, and the level of H3K27me3 at the CDKN2A locus wanes, now permitting p16 expression and cell senescence (Dhawan et al., 2009;Dhawan et al., 2009).Age-related derepression of genes is not entirely passive.For example, the H3K27me3 demethylase JMJD3 can compete with EZH2 for occupancy of CDKN2A, erase H3K27me3, and promote p16 expression.JMJD3 expression is induced by replicative exhaustion and also by the stress-responsive transcription factor NF-kB or by oncogenic stress (Agger et al., 2009;Barradas et al., 2009;De Santa et al., 2007).Interestingly, iPS experiments suggest that epigenetic features associated with aging can be reversed.In successfully reprogrammed iPSCs, the chromatin state of CDKN2A locus associated with aging is erased and restored to that of youthful cells (Meissner, 2010).\t\n\nThe consequences of age-related changes to the macromolecular components of a cell, particularly for long-lived postmitotic cells like neurons and myofibers, lead to gradual loss of normal structure and function-so-called ''chronological aging,'' marked simply by the passage of time.For continuously dividing cells, like those of the epithelia of the skin or gut, there is the added challenge of ''replicative aging,'' referring to the accumulation of cellular damage, such as telomere shortening and replication-associated DNA mutations, that occurs during the process of cell division (Rando, 2006;Liu and Rando, 2011).This is particularly relevant for adult stem cells because they divide throughout the life of the individual and therefore experience both chronological and replicative aging (Charville and Rando, 2011).As the burden of mutations increases with age, the likelihood that a cell will undergo apoptosis, malignant transformation, or senescence, which for diving cells means irreversible cell-cycle arrest (Kuilman et al., 2010), also increases.Although cellular function invariably declines with age, it may be that some of the changes, for example senescence and apoptosis, are actually adaptive in order to prevent cellular transformations such as metaplasia or neoplasia that may result from age-related genomic instability.",
      "\tChromatin Remodeling in Aging\n\nIt has been proposed for a long time that chromatin undergoes repressive remodeling during senescence [189].For instance, H4K20me3 increases with age in rat kidney and liver [190].H3K9me3 and heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) increases and redistributes in aged Drosophila melanogaster, leading to global alterations in aging-related gene expression [191].Consistently, oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) induces the formation of facultative heterochromatin domains, known as senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF) [192][193][194].SAHF are enriched with H3K9me3 and HP1, while excluding active histone modifications such as K3K9ac, and usually cause a stable repression of E2F target genes [194,195].H3K9me3 marks constitutive heterochromatin and is mainly mediated by Suv39h1/2 methyltransferase [196].The critical roles for Suv39h1/2 and H3K9me3mediated chromatin remodeling in aging are highlighted by the findings that loss of Suv39h1 ablates OIS in tumor mouse model [197], while Suv39h1 overexpression leads to growth retardation [198].",
      "\tHIGHER-ORDER CHROMATIN STRUCTURE IN AGING\n\nAging is characterized by several global changes in chromatin structure and function.Structurally, in aged cells several key architectural chromatin proteins, including the structural heterochromatin protein HP1, are lost because of posttranslational degradation (Scaffidi and Misteli 2006;Pegoraro et al. 2009).Similarly, in the premature aging disorder Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS), caused by a mutation in lamin A, one of the major architectural elements of the mammalian nucleus, the same chromatin proteins are lost and, most likely as a consequence of their absence, morphologically discernible heterochromatin blocks and peripheral heterochromatin are largely missing from HGPS patient cells (Goldman et al. 2004;Scaffidi and Misteli 2006).These defects are because of downregulation of the NUcleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase (NURD) chromatin remodeling complex (Pegoraro et al. 2009).Several components of NURD, including its catalytic histone deacetylase I (HDAC 1), are lost in normally aged and HGPS patient cells and removal of this complex from normal cells is sufficient to recapitulate most major aging-associated chromatin defects (Pegoraro et al. 2009).These observations are supported by the finding of reduced activity of several histone deacetylases in aged mice (Shen et al. 2008).Aging-related structural defects in chromatin are also seen in yeast S. cerevisiae where instability of ribosomal repeats in the nucleolus have been associated with aging (Sinclair and Guarente 1997) and in Caenorhabditis elegans where both internal and peripheral heterochromatin blocks are lost during aging (Haithcock et al. 2005).",

      "\tDISCUSSION\n\nThe inability to maintain complex biological structures contributes to the onset of tissue dysfunction and the eventual demise of organisms as they age.During replicative senescence of human fibroblasts chromatin is subject to extensive changes in the global distribution of euchromatin and heterochromatin [25,35].We found that the fundamental architecture of the genome undergoes profound alterations: an overall closing of chromatin in euchromatic gene-rich regions, which is opposed by a somewhat paradoxical relaxation of heterochromatin in gene poor and pericentromeric regions [25].The gene-poor regions overlap significantly with lamin-associated domains (LADs), are marked by H3K9Me3, and replicate late during S phase [35].The relative closing of euchromatic regions was associated with a dampening of global gene expression, and the relaxation of heterochromatic regions with increased transcription of RTEs, many of which are localized in LADs and are normally heavily heterochromatinized to prevent their expression.\t\n\nHere we report similar chromatin changes taking place during the normal aging of two mouse tissues (liver, skeletal muscle) as we have previously documented in senescent cells in vitro.In addition, we have added two new analytical methods to those used previously: assessment of the sensitivity of chromatin to nuclease digestion in intact, permeabilized nuclei, and a quantification of the overall polyadenylated mRNA content per cell.By both measures the overall level of chromatin compactness increases with aging: nuclei become more resistant to nuclease (Figure 1), and the total levels of mRNA decrease (Figure 2).These trends are consistent with our previous findings of ageassociated increases in the levels of a heterochromatin associated protein (macro H2A) in the same tissues [26].",

      "\t\n\nEvidence of global changes and imbalance of regional chromatin domains in humans come from in vitro studies in cultured cells.Senescence is a state of cell-cycle arrest in response to stress, linked to age-associated tissue decline in vivo (van Deursen, 2014).During senescence, many cultured mammalian cells develop senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF), regions of highly condensed chromatin associated with heterochromatic histone modifications, heterochromatic proteins, histone variant macroH2A, high-mobility group A (HMGA) proteins and late replicating regions in the genome (Chandra et al., 2012;Zhang et al., 2007).A genome-wide study of senescent chromatin showed that >30% of chromatin is dramatically reorganized in senescent cells, including the formation of large-scale domains (mesas) of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 over lamin-associated domains (LADs), as well as large losses (canyons) of H3K27me3 outside of LADs (Shah et al., 2013).These changes are linked to the transcriptional downregulation of lamin B1 in senescence (Freund et al., 2012;Shah et al., 2013;Shimi et al., 2011).The profound destabilization of heterochromatic LADs is correlated to autophagic degradation of lamin B1 and associated repressive histones (Dou et al., 2015).Additionally, senescent cells show strong enrichment of H4K16ac (acetylation at lysine 16 on H4) at promoter elements of active genes in which they overlap with HIRA and newly synthesized H3.3 peaks (Rai et al., 2014).HIRA, a DNA-replication-independent histone chaperone that deposits variant histone H3.3 and H4 is required for the steady-state maintenance of H4K16ac.These changes suggest that the senescent state hosts a dynamic and imbalanced chromatin environment that is markedly different from the proliferating state.\t\n\nMany chromatin-related senescence phenotypes occur in aging tissues from various organisms, underscoring the connection between senescence and longevity.High levels of histone macroH2A and heterochromatin protein HP1b accumulate with age in mouse and primate tissues (Herbig et al., 2006;Kreiling et al., 2011).Additionally, H3K9me3 is reduced in cultured cells from normal aged individuals and H4K20me3 is increased in the lysates of aged rats (Sarg et al., 2002;Scaffidi and Misteli, 2006).ChIP-seq in young and old hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) shows a modest increase in the number of H3K4me3 peaks with age, many of which broaden in coverage, especially over HSC identity and self-renewal genes.H3K27me3 peaks do not appreciably change in number, but also broaden with age (Sun et al., 2014).\t\n\nPathways affecting heterochromatin establishment and maintenance are tightly linked to senescence in mammalian cells, resulting in global and gene-specific changes linked to reduced cellular fitness.Constitutive heterochromatin structures are disorganized in senescence, as evidenced by reduced global DNA methylation (discussed below), H3K9me3 levels, and HP1 (Scaffidi andMisteli, 2005, 2006).Senescence is also marked by a deficiency in the polycomb-repressive protein EZH2, a histone methyltransferase, and subsequent decrease of repression-associated H3K27me3, leading to rapid senescence.While likely resulting in broader genome-wide effects, EZH2 and H3K27me3 loss also results in gene-specific upregulation of p16INK4a (p16), a key upregulated SASP and ubiquitous marker for cellular senescence (Bracken et al., 2007).Conversely, overexpression of EZH2 results in increased cellular lifespan (Bracken et al., 2007), an effect attributed through repression of p16.It is interesting to speculate that global H3K27me3 and heterochromatin maintenance may also be stabilized with EZH2 overexpression.",
      "\t\n\nSome genes related to 'chromatin organization and biogenesis' were downregulated in old oocytes (Fig. 2).For example, the expression of histone deacetylase 2 (Hdac2 ), which interacts with Dnmt1 to represses transcription, was also downregulated, as were histone acetyltransferases, Myst1 and Mrgx, which are related to Morf, involved in cellular senescence (68).Changes in these and other chromatin remodeling factors, combined with the specific changes in DNA methyltransferase expression, suggest that chromatin structure and epigenetic mechanisms may be appreciably dysregulated as oocytes age."

      "\tCONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS (RESETTING THE AGING CLOCK)\n\nThe aging process is unquestionably complex.During an organism's lifetime, aging cells undergo a plethora of changes and accumulate macromolecular damage.The aging phenotypes are manifested by the summation of alterations of many different signaling cascades.Here, we attempted to provide an overview of some of the major changes in aging cells, tissues, and organisms that have come to light in recent years through the lens of chromatin and epigenetic regulation.Genetic and environmental manipulations are unequivocally important to decipher the effect of any specific factor over the longevity process.It is becoming apparent mechanistically that many of those factors that do affect longevity act primarily through the modification of the epigenome.Undoubtedly, epigenetic influences over the aging process need to be incorporated into our current understanding of aging.Almost all classes of epigenetic alterations reported so far influence longevity pathways, adding further complexity to understanding the aging process.In summary, young healthy cells maintain an epigenetic state that promotes the formation of a compact chromatin structure and precise regulation of all the basic biological processes.However, aging cells experience alterations in all aspects of the chromatin landscape, DNA accessibility, and ncRNA production, until a threshold of altered gene expression and compromised genomic integrity is crossed, and the cells finally succumb to a permanent halt in progression through the cell cycle.The reversible nature of epigenetic mechanisms makes it possible to restore or reverse some of these phenotypes to attain more youthful cells.Whereas some of the molecular changes during aging can be categorized as causal to aging, other changes simply accompany the aging process.However, when characterizing the causes or consequences of aging, one has to carefully dissect the experimental findings because most of the relevant pathways are interconnected, making it difficult to separate the effects of the pro-aging pathways from bystander pathways.A concerted effort should be made to establish the hierarchical relationship among the relevant pathways to understand the exact causal network of aging and to derive effective therapies to counteract the aging process and age-associated diseases.There is still a great deal to learn about this complex biological process.Current progress and extensive utilization of next-generation sequencing techniques are enabling us to analyze age-associated changes at ever-increasing resolution.However, simultaneous gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies in different organisms are also crucial to understanding and providing evidence of the causal effects of certain pathways, to move beyond correlation analyses.A tour-de-force analysis of the effect of individually deleting 4700 yeast genes on replicative life span was recently completed, finding 237 genes whose deletion extends life span (146).However, we clearly have a lot more to learn about the aging process because 30 of those genes are so poorly understood that they have yet to be given functional names.\t\nOver the past decade, a growing number of studies have revealed that progressive changes to epigenetic information accompany aging in both dividing and nondividing cells.Functional studies in model organisms and humans indicate that epigenetic changes have a huge influence on the aging process.These epigenetic changes occur at various levels, including reduced bulk levels of the core histones, altered patterns of histone posttranslational modifications and DNA methylation, replacement of canonical histones with histone variants, and altered noncoding RNA expression, during both organismal aging and replicative senescence.The end result of epigenetic changes during aging is altered local accessibility to the genetic material, leading to aberrant gene expression, reactivation of transposable elements, and genomic instability.Strikingly, certain types of epigenetic information can function in a transgenerational manner to influence the life span of the offspring.Several important conclusions emerge from these studies: rather than being genetically predetermined, our life span is largely epigenetically determined; diet and other environmental influences can influence our life span by changing the epigenetic information; and inhibitors of epigenetic enzymes can influence life span of model organisms.These new findings provide better understanding of the mechanisms involved in aging.Given the reversible nature of epigenetic information, these studies highlight exciting avenues for therapeutic intervention in aging and age-associated diseases, including cancer.\t\n\nOver the past decade, a growing number of studies have revealed that progressive changes to epigenetic information accompany aging in both dividing and nondividing cells.Functional studies in model organisms and humans indicate that epigenetic changes have a huge influence on the aging process.These epigenetic changes occur at various levels, including reduced bulk levels of the core histones, altered patterns of histone posttranslational modifications and DNA methylation, replacement of canonical histones with histone variants, and altered noncoding RNA expression, during both organismal aging and replicative senescence.The end result of epigenetic changes during aging is altered local accessibility to the genetic material, leading to aberrant gene expression, reactivation of transposable elements, and genomic instability.Strikingly, certain types of epigenetic information can function in a transgenerational manner to influence the life span of the offspring.Several important conclusions emerge from these studies: rather than being genetically predetermined, our life span is largely epigenetically determined;

      "\t\n\nSeveral important conclusions emerge from the presented findings: there are at least two ways to reverse or inhibit senescence by epigenetic mechanisms, whereby a healthy life expectancy could be prolonged.The first way involves rejuvenation through effective epigenetic reprogramming in cells undergoing senescence or cells derived from very aged patients or patients with progeroid syndromes, by which the induction of in vitro-induced pluripotent stem cells is effective.Although our lifespan is largely epigenetically determined; diet and other environmental factors can influence it by changing the epigenetic information.So, another opportunity to reverse ageing that concerns epigenetic modifications is the pharmacological/nutritional modulation of cell fate; for instance, modification of senescence signalling pathways such as by IGF-induced agents [119,193].This last point considers the reversible nature of epigenetic modifications, thus, research on epigenome opens new avenues for therapeutic interventions in ageing and age-associated diseases, including the devastating AD.",
      "\t\n\nThe underlying cause of aging remains one of the central mysteries of biology.Recent studies in several different systems suggest that not only may the rate of aging be modified by environmental and genetic factors, but also that the aging clock can be reversed, restoring characteristics of youthfulness to aged cells and tissues.This Review focuses on the emerging biology of rejuvenation through the lens of epigenetic reprogramming.By defining youthfulness and senescence as epigenetic states, a framework for asking new questions about the aging process emerges.\t\n\nAlthough genetic and environmental interventions have clearly proven to be effective in prolonging life span, we postulate that those interventions, as well as the rejuvenating interventions described above, are, in fact, acting primarily to modify the epigenome.Consistent with this, genetic interventions directly targeting the epigenome can extend life span (Greer et al., 2010).Studying aging and rejuvenation through the lens of epigenetics and reprogramming therefore offers a fresh view of the mysteries of the aging process itself.The process of light passing through a film, focused by a lens, and projected to create a complex image is drawn as a metaphor for genetic information being processed and interpreted by epigenetic mechanisms to create complex cellular phenotypes.In this analogy, the film represents the genome (shown as a DNA double helix) containing the fundamental information, the lens represents the epigenome (represented as a string of nucleosomes) that allows that genetic information to be translated, and the Cell cover represents the resulting complex phenotype (shown as a mature neuron).In the vertical axis, the processes first of aging and then of rejuvenation are illustrated.With age, there is clearly a deterioration of the cellular phenotype, reflected by a blurring of the image.This may be due to intrinsic changes to DNA (depicted as double-strand breaks) and also to the epigenome (depicted as less well-organized nucleosomes), the latter resulting both from genomic changes and also from environmental influences.Together, these changes distort the genomic information of youth to create imperfect products, blurred as an image and structurally and functionally disrupted as a cell.Based on the ideas put forth in this Review, we postulate that most, if not all, of the rejuvenating effects, such as those that result from processes (e.g., fertilization, SCNT, iPS cell generation) or interventions (e.g., heterochronic parabiosis, NF-kB inhibition, mTOR inhibition) described, act by restoring the epigenomic lens back toward a more youthful state.The resulting image/cell may not be precisely ''young'' but has youthfulness restored by these processes and interventions that act by reprogramming the epigenome.It is thus the epigenetic lens that is critical for establishing the aged phenotype and that is the target for rejuvenating interventions and reprogramming that are responsible for the apparent rewinding of the aging clock.\t\n\nBeyond the genome and the epigenome, cellular aging is characterized by the accumulation of damaged macromolecules, including proteins and lipids, and highly stable aggregates of those molecules (Campisi and Vijg, 2009).These, too, are manifestations of aging that are also potentially ''reversible,'' either by dilution in dividing cells or by disaggregation and degradation followed by replacement with new undamaged macromolecules.Only mutated and deleted DNA sequences, for which no template, code, or cellular machinery exists to guide their correction, are inaccessible to the rejuvenation process.The notion that aging is at least in part, if not largely, a manifestation of epigenetic changes, including those that may be secondary to genomic mutations, offers a theoretical construct for understanding the mechanisms of rejuvenation.If so, it should be possible to characterize ''young'' and ''old'' cells by specific transcriptional and epigenetic profiles and states.Furthermore, the processes that underlie aging and rejuvenation should be identifiable in terms of regulators of epigenetic states.Although biomarkers of age have remained elusive, studies have begun to reveal key epigenetic features of aging cells.We present below some specific examples of the epigenetic changes identified in aged cells and the relationship between epigenetic regulators and life span.\tConcluding Remarks\n\nSeveral of the fundamental questions discussed above will be answered only with more detailed information on the genetic and epigenetic profiles associated with aging.Clearly, the establishment of transcriptional networks and epigenetic profiles for cells from different ages and across species will reveal the features that are generalizable characteristics of aging and allow for direct tests of whether it is possible, as with the relationship between pluripotent and differentiated states, to directly program a cell to be either young or old even if only transiently and incompletely.It is interesting that many of the rejuvenating interventions act on the stem cell compartments, perhaps reflecting shared genetic and biochemical pathways controlling stem cell function and longevity (Rando, 2006;Sharpless and DePinho, 2007;Jones and Rando, 2011).Many of the secrets to organismal longevity might, in fact, be linked to the biology of stem cell quiescence and selfrenewal.",
      "\t\n\nInterestingly, the only common effector on aging found among cell cultures, different model organisms, and humans is epigenetic modifications.Epigenetic modifications are indeed a part of every genetic response in the cell, but the existence of common age-related modifications and key-players is intriguing.Epigenetic alterations are \"core\" elements in cellular responses.They play an upstream role to specific cellular processes, and this might be the reason for the relatively joint phenotypes.Furthermore, epigenetic modifications that are related to ageassociated chromosomal rearrangements in yeast and flies might be a link to age-related DNA damage, where direct evidence were not found.",
      "\tConclusions and Perspectives\n\nThis review provides a comprehensive overview of the compelling epigenetic evidence linked to aging from animal, tissue, and cell-based models that continue to be critical for identifying key longevity pathways.Studies of chromatin changes suggest two recurring themes in aging: (1) global upregulation of activating marks and downregulation of repressive marks and (2) gene-specific changes in chromatin states regulating expression of key longevity genes.These general themes are heavily influenced by environmental stimuli, nutrient signaling, and metabolic state.While much has been uncovered in these studies, there remain many future challenges in epigenetic aging research, particularly with regard to characterizing key epigenetic changes that may be causal to aging.These challenges include linking specific chromatin modifications to changes in aging-specific signaling pathways using genetic manipulations, identifying causal epigenetic changes in age-related diseases, uncovering specific enzymes for targeted therapeutic strategies to improve lifespan and healthspan, linking metabolism to epigenetic outcomes in aging, particularly related to mitochondrial aging in which a vast amount of literature is already available (Bratic and Larsson, 2013), and optimizing epigenomic modification strategies to become a viable option for potential therapy.",
      "\tPerspectives and challenges\n\nEpigenetics has emerged as an important subject area in aging biology and may be able to explain many of the phenotypic changes related to the aging process.Nevertheless, further research in this field is needed to elucidate the functional role of epigenetic modifications accumulated during aging in the establishment of the aging phenotype.For instance, although it is possible to associate the accumulation of methylation at the promoters of tumour-suppressor genes during aging with the predisposition to developing cancer, there is no experimental or mechanistic evidence of a direct relationship between these genes and aging.In the same way, although TD2 and Alzheimer are considered diseases of aging and are known to be associated with several specific epigenetic alterations, the functional link between specific epigenetic modifications and the aging process itself is far from being definitively demonstrated.One of the most important challenges is to find more appropriate model systems in which genetic or epigenetic manipulation is possible and to identify clear characteristics that will allow the aging phenotype to be measured.Studies on humans are of evident interest from the clinical and applied point of view but are extremely difficult because of the lack of material.Moreover, inter-individual heterogeneity makes it hard to detect statistically significant differences in population studies and the long lifespan of the human being is an obstacle to following changes in single individuals.At the same time, there is intra-individual heterogeneity due to tissue-and cell-specific epigenetic mechanisms that cannot be overcome.Other models are not problem-free.So research is moving towards the study of different organisms in which it might be easier to associate a definite epigenetic change with the aged phenotype.Alternatively the comparison of data from different in vitro and in vivo models could provide the final answer.In recent years, technological innovations such as microarrays and ultra-high-throughput sequencing have enabled the global epigenetic landscape to be described, multiplying the amount of information that can be obtained from any given sample.Nevertheless, given the heterogeneity of epigenetic marks from cell to cell, further technical improvements are needed to improve the analysis of individual cells or homogeneous group of cells.Finally, new possibilities are opening up involving the use of imaging techniques in living (Yamagata, 2008) and whole organisms (Zinn et al., 2008).It is to be hoped that these will provide novel information about the epigenetic dynamics of the living cell.\t\n\nEpigenetic alteration associated with aging.",
      "\tEpigenomic studies are at hand\n\nAnother molecular level that could provide additional insight in the processes of aging is the epigenome, the intermediate layer of genomic information between the genome and transcriptome.Epigenetic regulation of transcription is mediated by histon modification, DNA methylation, and microRNAs.Changes in the epigenome with chronological age have been explored and show that methylation patterns of genes involved in e.g., development and morphogenesis, DNA binding and regulation of transcription [61][62][63] tend to change with age.A recent remarkable finding in a small study sample, confirmed in a cohort of 501 individuals ranging from birth to 99 years, was the progressive linear increase in methylation with age at the ELOVL2 gene [64].Because the epigenomic field recently became more accessible for the screening of large study populations, the identification of a new range of epigenetic biomarkers is at hand.To consider such epigenetic measures as markers for biological age, confounding of cell type distributions should be accounted for -like in transcriptomic studies -and effects should be established using various study designs."

      "\tIntroduction\n\nWith the development of human genomics research, a large number of studies of the genetics of longevity have been conducted.Scientists from various countries have proposed many different theories concerning the mechanisms of aging from different perspectives, involving oxidative stress, energy metabolism, signal transduction pathways, immune response, etc. [1,2].These mechanisms interact with each other and are influenced by heredity to some degree [2,3].The identification of longevity-related biological markers is critical to an indepth understanding of the mechanisms of carrier protection against common disease and/or of the retardation of the process of aging.",
      "\t\n\nBuilding on previous work in this system, the current study tests three primary hypotheses about how variation in mtDNA and mitochondrial function relate to variation in life-history traits and aging within this system (Fig. 1): (1) First, we test whether rates of cellular oxygen consumption in isolated immune cells exhibit patterns that are consistent with the hypothesis that cellular processes drive whole-organism senescence and aging, and if these patterns differ between the SA and FA ecotypes and between sexes.By measuring basal, ATP-production associated, and maximal rates of cellular oxygen consumption, we further test for evidence that phenotypic divergence is dependent on a specific aspect of oxidative phosphorylation within immune cells.The energetics of these cells are particularly important given their essential role in modulating disease and infection, important factors contributing to senescence (Metcalf et al., 2019).We predict that SA snakes will maintain levels of cellular oxygen consumption across age, whereas the FA snakes will show a decline with age, especially in ATP-associated rates, possibly due to continual degradation of electron transport chain functionality from accumulating oxidative damage and reduced DNA repair mechanisms (Robert and Bronikowski, 2010;Schwartz and Bronikowski, 2013). ( 2) Second, we expand our mitochondrial genomics dataset to quantify mtDNA genetic structure across the landscape and test whether mtDNA haplotypes, and alleles at a nonsynonymous SNP in the Cytochrome B (CytB) gene correlate with aging ecotypes. (3) Third, we test the hypothesis that variation in mtDNA correlates with whole-organism variation in metabolic rates, suggesting a pathway linking mitochondrial genetic variation in mtDNA to whole-organism energetics.We first test whether different haplotypes differ in resting metabolic rate.Then, we test the effects of the nonsynonymous SNP in CytB on resting metabolic rate.The CytB gene encodes a component of complex III of the ETC, and was previously found to segregate between these life-history ecotypes (Schwartz et al., 2015).This SNP results in an amino acid substitution from isoleucine (aliphatic, hydrophobic) to threonine (hydrophilic) on a region that comes into close contact with a nuclear-encoded subunit (Schwartz et al., 2015).We combine previously published and new data on whole-organism resting metabolic rates (oxygen consumption) to test for the effects of this nonsynonymous mutation in three populations where we find heterogeneity at this nucleotide, thus allowing us to disentangle the effects of shared environment (population) from sequence variation (SNP).We predict that this SNP will correlate with variation in whole-organism metabolic rate, demonstrating a putatively adaptive difference between the derived and ancestral sequence.By utilizing this integrative data setfrom genes to organelles to whole organisms to populationsin a known life-history context, we are able to test hypotheses across levels of organization to provide a more complete picture of the complicated story of mitochondria and life history (Havird et al., 2019).\t\n\nWorking within a generalized framework that integrates the environmental pressures driving the evolution of metabolic rates and lifehistories can provide insight into how these traits are integrated.In Fig. 1A we present such a framework.Central to this framework, and the best place to start our investigation of these complex interactions across scales and across lifespans, is the mitochondrion.In the cells of eukaryotes, the overwhelming majority of energy substrate (adenosine triphosphate; ATP) to sustain life's functions is produced in mitochondria via oxidative phosphorylation in the electron transport chain (reviewed in Hood et al., 2018;Solaini et al., 2010).Yet these mitochondria must carefully balance their energetic and oxygen demands, their capacity to meet cellular need for ATP, and their production of potentially toxic and harmful byproducts (Barja, 2002;Barja, 2004;Harmon, 1956;Lee and Wei, 2012;Muller et al., 2007).On one hand, energy flow through mitochondria can determine the pace of life of an individual, with implications for lifespan and 'rate of living'.On the other hand, the production of damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS) molecules is implicated in reduced performance and decline during old age, leading to the free radical theory of aging (or oxidative stress theory of aging; Balaban et al., 2005;Barja, 2002;Lyons and Kozak, 2019;Robert et al., 2007;Speakman, 2005).In addition, mitochondria possess a genome that encodes core peptides to electron transport chain (ETC) protein complexes along with nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins (Rand et al., 2004;Sunnucks et al., 2017;Wolff et al., 2014).This maternally inherited mitochondrial genome is subject to extensive replication across its lifetime and is linked to aging phenotypes independent of the production of damage-causing reactive oxygen species (Pinto and Moraes, 2015;Seo and Leeuwenburgh, 2015).For these reasons, any variation in mitochondrial function, especially if it is sexor age-dependent, will have ramifications for the evolution of life histories (Dowling and Simmons, 2009;Finkel and Holbrook, 2000;Fletcher et al., 2013;Wikelski and Ricklefs, 2001;Wolff et al., 2016).",
      "\t\nBackground: The accumulation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations, and the reduction of mtDNA copy number, both disrupt mitochondrial energetics, and may contribute to aging and age-associated phenotypes.However, there are few genetic and epidemiological studies on the spectra of blood mtDNA heteroplasmies, and the distribution of mtDNA copy numbers in different age groups and their impact on age-related phenotypes.In this work, we used whole-genome sequencing data of isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from the UK10K project to investigate in parallel mtDNA heteroplasmy and copy number in 1511 women, between 17 and 85 years old, recruited in the TwinsUK cohorts.Results: We report a high prevalence of pathogenic mtDNA heteroplasmies in this population.We also find an increase in mtDNA heteroplasmies with age ( = 0.011, P = 5.77e-6), and showed that, on average, individuals aged 70-years or older had 58.5% more mtDNA heteroplasmies than those under 40-years old.Conversely, mtDNA copy number decreased by an average of 0.4 copies per year ( = 0.395,P = 0.0097).Multiple regression analyses also showed that age had independent effects on mtDNA copy number decrease and heteroplasmy accumulation.Finally, mtDNA copy number was positively associated with serum bicarbonate level (P = 4.46e-5), and inversely correlated with white blood cell count (P = 0.0006).Moreover, the aggregated heteroplasmy load was associated with blood apolipoprotein B level (P = 1.33e-5), linking the accumulation of mtDNA mutations to age-related physiological markers.Conclusions: Our population-based study indicates that both mtDNA quality and quantity are influenced by age.An open question for the future is whether interventions that would contribute to maintain optimal mtDNA copy number and prevent the expansion of heteroplasmy could promote healthy aging.\t\n\nBackground: The accumulation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations, and the reduction of mtDNA copy number, both disrupt mitochondrial energetics, and may contribute to aging and age-associated phenotypes.However, there are few genetic and epidemiological studies on the spectra of blood mtDNA heteroplasmies, and the distribution of mtDNA copy numbers in different age groups and their impact on age-related phenotypes.In this work, we used whole-genome sequencing data of isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from the UK10K project to investigate in parallel mtDNA heteroplasmy and copy number in 1511 women, between 17 and 85 years old, recruited in the TwinsUK cohorts.\t\n\nHowever, no studies have investigated whether the effects of age on the two mitochondrial characteristics are independent, as it is possible that age can affect mtDNA copy number through age-related heteroplasmy changes or vice versa.In this study, we demonstrated that age was independently associated with mtDNA copy number and heteroplasmy.Furthermore, compared to previous studies, we also included WBC count and platelet count as covariates in the regression model to adjust for potential bias caused by blood cell contaminations.Mitochondrial biogenesis has been proposed as a marker of many age-related health outcomes or even the aging process itself [58].Our results suggested that both mtDNA heteroplasmy and copy number should be included to establish this relationship.Mitochondrial mutations that occur early in life can clonally expand to cause mitochondrial dysfunction and further contribute to aging through a number of potential mechanisms including decreased oxidative capacity and energy production capacity, but also nuclear signaling and transcriptional dysregulation [59][60][61][62][63].In addition, decreased mtDNA copy number may also lead to decreased energy production and/or decreased mitochondrial gene expression [57,64].Maintaining both mtDNA quality and quantity together may help to counteract or slow down the aging process.",
      "\t\n\nIn 1989, based on expanding molecular biology studies of diseases caused by mtDNA mutations, my colleagues and I (216) proposed the \"mitochondrial theory of aging\" that the somatic accumulation of mitochondrial mutations and the subsequent cytoplasmic segregation of these mutations during life is a major contributor to the gradual loss of cellular bioenergetic capacity within tissues and organs associated with general senescence and diseases of aging.The hypothesis encompasses the concept that a decline in bioenergetic capacity in tissues will contribute to age-associated diseases, such as those that affect the cardiac, vascular, and neuromuscular systems.\t\n\nHence, progressive age-dependent damage in mitochondrial genomes and functions is an important contributor to human aging.\t\n\nAccumulated evidence to date exhorts to unify both ideas of the free radical theory of aging and mitochondrial theory of aging to be \"the redox mechanism of mitochondrial aging\" (281), that the mtDNA's oxidative damage results in cumulative increase in somatic mutations in mtDNA leading to bioenergetic deficit, cell death, and aging.The germline mutations in mtDNA as well as nDNA specific for the patients with mitochondrial diseases accelerate the oxidative damage and somatic mutations synergistically leading to their phenotypic expression as premature aging or death.\t\n\nThere have been few reports on distinct correlation between mitochondrial morphology and human aging, except changes in number and size of mitochondria associated with age.Concerning the gross structure of mitochondria, the overwhelming importance of the cell nucleus in mitochondrial biogenesis should be noted, because the major parts of mitochondrial proteins are encoded by nuclear genes that are stable during life with the efficient repair mechanism for nDNA.\t\n\nThe mitochondrial theory of aging was located in skeletal muscle (150, 392), heart muscle that the somatic accumulation of mitochondrial (145, 149), and brain (231).The exponential increase in genome mutations during life is a major cause of human aging and degenerative diseases was based on the molecular and cell biology studies: the high frequency of gene mutation in mtDNA; the small size of the mitochondrial genome and its known information content; the lack of an efficient repair mechanism for mtDNA, unlike nDNA; and the somatic segregation of individual mtDNA during eukaryotic cell division.This proposal has found substantial support in recent publications that have documented an extensive array of deletions in mtDNA of many human tissues that accumulate in an age-related manner accompanied bY a substantial fall in mitochondrial oxidative capacity.Progressive age-protooncogene (395), which inhibits leukocyte apoptosis, is associated with the mitochondrial membrane (156).",
      "\t\n\nAging is a complex process as a time-dependent progressive loss of physiological integrity, leading to impaired function and increased vulnerability to death [74], and as we described above, aging is highly associated with mtDNA mutations; in fact heteroplasmy incidence increases with age, while lower mtDNA copy number has been reported in aged populations as well as mitochondria morphology, abundance, and oxidative phosphorylation activity [75,76].Interestingly, in aging the significant amount of these mutations converges in sites that encode structural subunits of the ETC such as complexes I and III [77], leading to OxPhos uncoupling and mitochondrial dysfunction in aged population.Since there are several limitations to study mitochondrial metabolism in human samples, in this section we briefly described the implications of mitochondrial metabolism for aging in the most studied and high energy demand human tissues, such as skeletal muscle, heart, and brain.\t\n\nAll the previous suggests that the mitochondrial field still poses interesting crossroads that when studied will bring quite promising targets to improve human healthy aging.",
      "\tINTRODUCTION\n\nAbout 10 years ago it was proposed that aging is caused by life-long accumulation of somatic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations (1), which compromises cellular energy metabolism and/or increases intracellular oxidative stress (2).Ultimately, this could result in the development of the multiple degenerative changes in tissues that become manifest in old age.It has been shown that mtDNA deletions and, with less certainty, mtDNA point mutations, increase with advancing age (recently reviewed in 3,4).These data are consistent with the mitochondrial theory of aging but do not exclude the possibility that accumulation of mtDNA mutations accompanies, but does not cause aging.",

      "\t\nAging is an intricate phenomenon characterized by progressive decline in physiological functions and increase in mortality that is often accompanied by many pathological diseases.Although aging is almost universally conserved among all organisms, the underlying molecular mechanisms of aging remain largely elusive.Many theories of aging have been proposed, including the freeradical and mitochondrial theories of aging.Both theories speculate that cumulative damage to mitochondria and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) is one of the causes of aging.Oxidative damage affects replication and transcription of mtDNA and results in a decline in mitochondrial function which in turn leads to enhanced ROS production and further damage to mtDNA.In this paper, we will present the current understanding of the interplay between ROS and mitochondria and will discuss their potential impact on aging and age-related diseases.",
      "\t\n\nMitochondrial genomes harboring large deletions are known to accumulate both in patients with heteroplasmic mtDNA mutations and in normal individuals during aging, particularly in postmitotic tissues such as muscle and brain (3).These observations support the mitochondrial theory of aging, which states that the slow accumulation of impaired mitochondria is the driving force of the aging process.This idea is attractive because it can be reconciled with the free radical theory of aging, which argues that oxidative damage plays a key role in senescence.Among the numerous mechanisms known to generate oxidants, leakage of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide from the mitochondrial electron transport chain are the chief candidates.Increased damage to mtDNA could exacerbate this leakage of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (4).",
