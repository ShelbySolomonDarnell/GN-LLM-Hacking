    "1. Start with an initial linkage or association: This is the first step in a genetic study where a trait or disease is linked to a specific region of the genome.  2. Perform Laboratory Genotyping: This involves determining the genetic variation of an individual by examining their DNA sequence using biological assays and comparing it to a standard sequence.  3. Use Genomic Sequence: The role of genomic sequence is crucial at every stage. It serves as a common thread that ties all the stages together.  4. Establish True Orthology: Determine the true orthology between genes in different species. If two genes are truly orthologous, their evolution closely follows patterns of speciation.  5. Apply Bioinformatics: Use bioinformatics tools and techniques to analyze the data. This can be applied to sequence data from any collection of organisms.  6. Understand Genome Structure and Content: Provide an overview of genome structure and content to provide a context for subsequent discussions.  7. Improve DNA Sequencing Methods: Constantly work on improving DNA sequencing methods with the ultimate goal of sequencing a human genome in a single day for a cost of about US $1,000.  8. Interpret the Information: The major challenge ahead is the interpretation of this information. Understand how our genes interact with each other, and how the environment contributes to the development of health and disease.  9. Consider the Implications: Understand the individual and societal implications of knowing our genome sequence.  10. Keep Up with Technological Advances: With further technological advances, other previously unimaginable research approaches will become real.",
    "The length of telomeres is significant as it is associated with aging, disease, and mortality. Longer telomeres are generally associated with better health outcomes, including protection from age-related diseases, better cognitive function, and healthier lipid profiles. Shorter telomeres, on the other hand, have been linked to higher risks of heart disease, infection-related death, and other diseases. Telomere length can also be influenced by factors such as stress, with high-stress situations potentially leading to faster telomere shortening and premature aging.",
    "The traits are determined by the combination of genes from both the sperm and the egg. This process involves meiosis, where each gamete (sperm and egg) contributes one chromosome to each pair, resulting in a zygote with a full complement of 23 chromosome pairs. The process of recombination or crossing over, where similar DNA sequences from the paired chromosomes swap genetic material, also plays a crucial role in determining the traits of the offspring. This results in a shuffling of genetic material and contributes to the genetic variation seen among offspring.",
    "Genetic tracing is matrilineal due to the inheritance of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which is passed from mother to all her children without any admixture from the father. This allows for a clear lineage tracing through the maternal line. In contrast, Y-DNA is passed from father to son, allowing for patrilineal tracing, but it does not provide information about the genetic contributions of other ancestors in a family tree.",
    "The difference between X and Y DNA is not explicitly discussed in the context of determining QTLs in the provided text. However, in general, X and Y chromosomes are different in size and gene content, which can be identified through genetic sequencing. In the context of QTL studies, these differences could potentially influence the traits being studied. However, the specific process of how this is done in QTL mapping is not detailed in the provided text."

      "In birds, where erythrocyte telomere length (ETL) is measured, the majority of species sampled have shown no sex difference (36).Nonetheless, bird telomere dynamics are complex and, as with humans, may be affected by environment and stress.For example, a longitudinal study of black-tailed gulls (Larus crassitostris) over 2-5 years found no correlation between ETL and age or sex.Rather, ETL attrition was correlated with reduced food availability and environmental stressors (55).In a captive zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) population, male and female mean telomere length decreased with increasing age of the animals, but did differ between sexes (56).As these examples illustrate, the relationship between telomere length, lifespan, and sex is likely to be complex in other vertebrates.",
      "Comparative studies of age-related telomere attrition in other species also reveal a variety of patterns.Barrett and Richardson (36) recently summarized the comparative data available on sex differences in telomere length.They found a strong correlation between male-biased mortality and either shorter telomeres or greater telomere attrition in males across bird and mammal taxa.However, telomere length did not differ between males and females in species where females are shorter-lived than males (36), suggesting that telomere shortening is not associated with species-specific longevity in a simple linear fashion.These studies generally suffer from relatively small sample sizes and are largely cross-sectional.Further, the use of diverse assays, different tissues (eg, leukocytes in mammals vs erythrocytes in birds), and lack of standardized benchmarks for accuracy makes comparisons between studies difficult.",
      "In some organisms, there is no clear relationship between telomere length and lifespan.Age-related telomere attrition could not be detected in Daphnia pulex (57) or sea urchin species (Strongylocentrotus franciscanus and Lytechinus variegatus) (58).Studies in C. elegans examining natural variation in telomere length and experimentally manipulated telomere length detect no correlation with lifespan (59,60), and in Drosophila, which uses a telomerase-independent mechanism for telomere maintenance, there is a similar lack of correlation between longevity and telomere length (61).Similarly, data on sex differences in age-related telomere shortening are mixed.For example, in the ant species Lasius niger, the rate of telomere shortening is more rapid in short-lived males compared to longer-lived females.But, mean telomere length does not differ between the two types of females, queens and workers, despite the fact that queens live much longer than workers (up to 28 years vs 2-3 months) (62).These findings suggest that the question of how telomere shortening affects aging across species and how sex affects telomere attrition rates are complex.",
      "With new methodologies to assess relative telomere length by Q-PCR, studies were designed to address the impact of telomere length on aging, aging associated pathologies, and mortality.One such study has correlated shorter leukocyte telomere lengths at age 60 with a three times higher risk of heart disease and an eightfold increase in risk of infection-related death (36), thereby associating measured relative cellular aging with disease and life expectancy.In a similar way, chronic stress was shown to correlate with short leukocyte telomere length, a phenomenon attributed to higher levels of oxidative stress at the cellular level (70).More recent studies have linked telomere length in smooth muscle cells with senescence and disease severity in patients with atherosclerosis (141,150).Leukocyte telomere length was also short in a cohort of similar patients and associated with a higher risk of developing occult cardiovascular disease (71).More data are needed to understand and validate the use of leukocyte telomere length as a biomarker for cardiovascular and other diseases.",
      "Shortening of the telomeres at the ends of chromosomes has been associated with age-related disease and mortality [16][17][18].A recent study identified a common haplotype of four SNPs in the human telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (hTERT) that is enriched in centenarians and associated with longer telomere length [19].It was also shown that centenarians and their offspring maintain longer telomeres compared with controls and that longer telomeres are associated with protection from age-related diseases, better cognitive function and lipid profiles of healthy ageing [19].",
      "New research has indicated how social factors, such as subordination, may translate into biological effects (epel et al. 2004;Chae et al. 2014).In a now classic study, epel et al. ( 2004) examined the telomere lengths of fifty-eight healthy premenopausal women who either had a healthy child (n = 19) or were giving care to a chronically ill child (n = 39. )They measured perceived stress, years of caregiving, telomere length, and oxidative stress.They found highly statistically significant differences in telomere length between women taking care of chronically ill children and those who had healthy children.They found highly statistically significant negative correlations between telomere length and perceived stress and years of caregiving.Telomerase activity had highly statistically significant negative correlations with perceived stress and years of caregiving.Oxidative stress was highly positively correlated with perceived stress and years of caregiving.They concluded that the telomere length shortening was equivalent to 9 to 17 years of aging in the high stress group.Telomere length is considered a biomarker of aging (Finch and Kirkwood 2000).Thus, this study showed that caregiver stress had essentially aged these women 9 to 17 years compared to women who had healthy children.",
      "The single, consistent predictor of the rate of telomere attrition shown in multiple adult and the few child longitudinal studies is the baseline measurement of telomere length at the start of each study.This suggests the importance of understanding predictors of telomere length prior to adulthood, as it determines in part the rate of change (Revesz et al. 2014a, b;Nordfjall et al. 2009).Moreover, longitudinal studies in adults have had found that telomere attrition rate is dependent on baseline telomere length independent of any phenotypic predictors of shortening, such as disease or demographic variables (Nordfjall et al. 2009), attesting to the importance of studies to evaluate risk factors for shortening prior to adulthood.",
      "Rates of decline in childhood may be particularly relevant for later chronic disease risk as shorter telomere length has been implicated in disease progression through exposure to cellular senescence, inflammatory cytokines and adipocyte hypertrophy (Raschenberger et al. 2015;Willeit et al. 2014;Monickaraj et al. 2012;Fyhrquist et al. 2013).",
      "Adult studies have also found a negative correlation with baseline telomere length, suggesting a negative feedback regulation of leukocyte telomere length (Farzaneh-Far et al. 2010;Aviv et al. 2009;Epel et al. 2008;Nordfjall et al. 2009).It is possible that while our follow-up period was shorter than Shalev et al. 2013 and adult studies, which had a minimum of 5 year intervals with the exception of Puterman et al. (2015) who followed for a one-year time period, there may be biological regulation of telomere length at 4 and 5 years of age such that shorter telomeres are more robustly maintained, whereas longer telomeres have greater rates of decline, over a short period of one year.It is unlikely that this relationship is due to assay error or regression to the mean given the consistency of our findings across studies.We have had similar findings of longer telomeres having greater rates of decline and shorter telomeres being maintained in our different studies (Farzaneh-Far et al. 2010;Epel et al. 2008;Puterman et al. 2015).",
      "We found primarily maintenance and lengthening from 4 to 5 years of age in children, with minimal telomere attrition, indicating that most of the telomere loss happens in the first 4 years, plateauing by age 4. Lastly, we found close to 10 % of the variance in rate of change in children shared by mothers.While some of this shared variance is genetic, there are likely environmental factors that need to be further identified that impact rate of telomere length change.",
      "Abstract Telomeres are the protective complexes at the end of chromosomes, required for genomic stability.Little is known about predictors of attrition in young children or the relationship between parental and child patterns of telomere change.Telomere length was assessed twice over one year, at 4 and at 5 years of age, in Latino preschool children (n = 77) and their mothers (n = 70) in whole blood leukocytes.Maternal and child rates of attrition during the same time period were compared in 70 mother-child pairs.More children showed lengthened telomeres over one year compared to their mothers and very few children showed attrition (2.6 %).Approximately 31 % of children and 16 % of mothers displayed lengthening over one year while 66 % of children showed maintenance in contrast with 74 % of mothers.The strongest predictor for child telomere length change was child's baseline telomere length (r = \u22120.61,p < 0.01).Maternal rate of change was associated with child rate of change (r = 0.33, p < 0.01).After controlling for child baseline telomere length, the relationship between child and maternal rate of change trended towards significance (Coeff = 0.20, 95 % CI \u22120.03 to 0.43; p = 0.08).",
      "Blackburn and Epel, a health psychologist who did original research on how specific lifestyle and psychological habits can protect telomeres, published The Telomere Effect (Blackburn & Epel, 2017), in which they suggested that individuals with shorter telomeres developed diseases earlier in life (a shorter \"disease span\").What follows is the evidence from these authors, their colleagues, and other researchers describing how length of telomeres contributes to mind-body connection and healthy longevity.",
      "As early as at the time of birth, each of the 92 telomeres of the human genome has its own characteristic length.Additionally, each telomere shortens by its individual attrition rate.In general, longer telomeres at birth are associated with higher age-dependent attrition rates and vice versa.Overall, telomere shortening appears more dynamic in males.",
      "In conclusion, a combination of overall and chromosomespecifi c shorter telomeres and more pronounced age-dependent telomere erosion could be observed in males.There is a prospective clinical study strongly suggesting that longer telomeres decrease the risk of dying (Cawthon et al., 2003).With this in mind, the telomere length discrepancies between the sexes may indeed be a factor infl uencing the differences in their life expectancy.",
      "In every chromosome a linear decline of telomere length with age was observed, being more pronounced in men independent of the examined chromosome arm.This might suggest that telomere length on single chromosome arms may be infl uenced by the same factors which determine overall telomere length.",

      "To date, these characteristics in telomere lengths could not be set in a biological context, as only a few groups have provided detailed information about chromosome-specifi c patterns of telomere distribution (Lansdorp et al., 1996;Graakjaer et al., 2003).Whether accumulation of short telomeres (Martens et al., 2000;Londono-Vallejo et al., 2001) or rather the shortest telomere of one specifi c chromosome arm (Hemann et al., 2001) elicits senescence, remains an open question so far.",
      "In recent literature, there are hints that the average telomere length may be higher in women and that their annual shortening rate may be somewhat lower (Vaziri et al., 1993;Rufer et al., 1998;Jeanclos et al., 2000), but these reported differences failed to reach statistical signifi cance except for one study (Jeanclos et al., 2000).Here, we provide compelling evidence that this is indeed the case.",
      "It is generally accepted that telomeres shorten during DNA replication both in vitro and in vivo.In individuals, short telomeres are considered to be a sign of advanced age.Cawthon and coworkers (2003) showed that telomere shortening in humans likely contributes to mortality, supporting the hypothesis that they might act as a mitotic clock (Allsopp et al., 1992).Telomere length dynamics, however, does not seem to Abstract.During aging, telomeres are gradually shortened, eventually leading to cellular senescence.By T/C-FISH (telomere/centromere-FISH), we investigated human telomere length differences on single chromosome arms of 205 individuals in different age groups and sexes.For all chromosome arms, we found a linear correlation between telomere length and donor age.Generally, males had shorter telomeres and higher attrition rates.Every chromosome arm had its individual age-specifi c telomere length and erosion pattern, resulting in an unexpected heterogeneity in chromosomespecifi c regression lines.This differential erosion pattern, however, does not seem to be accidental, since we found a correlation between average telomere length of single chromosome arms in newborns and their annual attrition rate.Apart from the above-mentioned sex-specifi c discrepancies, chromosome arm-specifi c telomere lengths were strikingly similar in men and women.This implies a mechanism that arm specifi cally regulates the telomere length independent of gender, thus leading to interchromosomal telomere variations.",
      "Shortening of the telomeres at the ends of chromosomes has been associated with age-related disease and mortality [16][17][18].A recent study identified a common haplotype of four SNPs in the human telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (hTERT) that is enriched in centenarians and associated with longer telomere length [19].It was also shown that centenarians and their offspring maintain longer telomeres compared with controls and that longer telomeres are associated with protection from age-related diseases, better cognitive function and lipid profiles of healthy ageing [19]."

      "Selection could occur at multiple levels, from germ cell generation and propagation to fertilization and early embryonic growth.Chromosomal abnormalities, including aneuploidy, were found in 10-20% of spermatozoa and oocytes (20) and in the cleaved embryo, with a 21% rate of abnormalities in preimplantation embryos (21).These findings led to a model for natural selection against chromosome abnormalities (21).Selection extends to the end of gestation: Only approximately 30% of all conceptions result in a live birth, with more than half of aborted fetuses containing chromosomal abnormalities (22), a number likely to be an underestimate because of technological limitations in measuring all possible mutations.But even in the very small fraction of germ cell duos that survive this withering genome attack and result in a live birth, a number of severe de novo mutations will still be found (23).The data on gross chromosomal alterations suggest that overall, mutation frequency early in life is very high.The functional consequence, however, is limited because of selection.Somewhat surprisingly, this picture points toward an initial decline in genomic alterations, allowing the adult individual to acquire a somatic genome optimally equipped to provide function.",

      "Sex brings harmful alleles together into the same genetic background, allowing selection to more efficiently purge them from the population and potentially producing some offspring that are fitter than either parent. However, the benefit of recombining deleterious mutations may depend on the nature of the epistatic interactions between them. The mutational deterministic hypothesis (Kondrashov 1988) depends partly on this epistasis.",
      "In most plants and animals, sex is a necessary component of reproduction, and the question for evolutionary biologists is why reproductive mechanisms have evolved that way. In one of the experiments described next, evolutionary geneticists have nevertheless devised a way to compare evolution with and without recombination in the obligately sexual fruit fly.",
      "This disparity in investment is the basis for the twofold cost: asexual females hypothetically could transmit twice as many alleles at the same cost. In most plants and animals, mates tend to be unrelated, leading to outcrossing. But sex usually also involves the basic process of physical recombination: the breakage and reunion of two different DNA or RNA molecules. Of these two processes, recombination is clearly the more widespread feature of sexual reproduction.

      "The reason for the rarity of these mutations is natural selection: If the mutations result in disorders that decrease health and reproductive fitness, they will eventually be eliminated from a population.In exceptional cases, mutations may cause both beneficial and detrimental consequences, resulting in opposing forces of positive selection and negative selection that may cause the mutations to be preserved at nonrare frequencies in a population.For example, the HbS mutation in the HBB gene (which produces the \u03b2 subunit of hemoglobin) causes sickle cell disease when present in both alleles, a detrimental consequence, but protects against malaria when present in 1 allele, a beneficial consequence, ensuring that the mutation persists in populations in areas of the world where malaria is endemic.Genes are passed from parents to offspring via the process of meiosis by which gametes, the egg cells in the mother and the sperm cells in the father, are generated.Ordinarily, each cell has 23 pairs of chromosomes; the gametes have 23 unpaired chromosomes.In meiosis, the 23 pairs are split so that each gamete receives 1 chromosome from each pair (Figures 8 and 9).Two gametes (egg and sperm) ultimately join into a single cell, the zygote, which has the full complement of 23 chromosome pairs restored.If all goes well, the zygote gives rise to a live offspring.",

      "In the generation of gametes, crossing over regularly occurs, and genetic information is swapped between members of a chromosome pair.That doesn't matter within inbred animals, because the swapped parts are identical.In an F 1 animal, however, the chromosomes of a particular pair are genetically different, one each having come from each parent.Each gamete produced will be unique, as will be each F 2 zygote formed by uniting of the gametes from two F 1 parents.An F 2 group thus provides for expression of some genetic variability.This variability is limited to the allelic differences existing between the parent strains of the F 1 s, so that another F 2 , derived from different inbred strains, will express different genetic differences.",
      "Sex brings harmful alleles together into the same genetic background, allowing selection to more efficiently purge them from the population and potentially producing some offspring that are fitter than either parent. However, the benefit of recombining deleterious mutations may depend on the nature of the epistatic interactions between them. The mutational deterministic hypothesis (Kondrashov 1988) depends partly on this epistasis.",
      "In most plants and animals, sex is a necessary component of reproduction, and the question for evolutionary biologists is why reproductive mechanisms have evolved that way. In one of the experiments described next, evolutionary geneticists have nevertheless devised a way to compare evolution with and without recombination in the obligately sexual fruit fly.",
      "This disparity in investment is the basis for the twofold cost: asexual females hypothetically could transmit twice as many alleles at the same cost. In most plants and animals, mates tend to be unrelated, leading to outcrossing. But sex usually also involves the basic process of physical recombination: the breakage and reunion of two different DNA or RNA molecules. Of these two processes, recombination is clearly the more widespread feature of sexual reproduction. A variety of reproductive systems, such as selfing and automixis, involve recombination but not outcrossing. In contrast, relatively few reproductive systems have outcrossing without recombination.",
      "Aberrant recombination patterns on chromosomes that have missegregated have also been identified as an important factor, in both male and female gametes (Table I).This is because recombination together with cohesion of sister chromatids establish the unique 'bivalent' chromosome structure where homologous partner chromosomes are tethered together, a configuration that is critical for their accurate segregation in meiosis I (Fig. 2A).The remarkable feature is that recombination occurs in foetal oocytes whereas chromosome segregation takes place decades later (Fig. 2A).Since mammalian oocytes are arrested at the G2/M transition (or dictyate stage), this raises the intriguing question of how the bivalent is maintained until the meiotic divisions.",
      "Traditionally, it has been agreed that the \ufb01nal sex of an individual (phenotypic sex) depends on two sequential processes: the sex determination system of the species and the gonad differentiation process (Valenzuela, 2008). However, recently, these two seemingly distinct processes are viewed as part of a general process leading to gonad formation and sex ratios (Sarre et al. , 2004; Quinn et al. , 2011; Uller and Helantera\u0308, 2011).",

      "Because of the small contribution, through the sperm, of the paternal transcriptome to the fertilized zygote, and because of the stronger maternal contribution to child rearing in most model organisms, parental effects are typically thought of as synonymous with maternal effects, although true paternal effects are known to exist (Rando, 2012). Maternal effects have been shown to be important during embryonic development, leading to differences in the birth weight of mice depending on the genotype of the mother (Cowley et al. , 1989; Wolf et al. , 2011).",
      "Therefore, the resulting phenotypic patterns lag a generation behind the genetic transmission of the causal variants. The most well-studied parental genetic effects are caused by deposition of maternal transcripts into the egg prior to fertilization, resulting in differences in early embryonic development depending on the genotype of the mother. Certain genes have also been shown to respond to maternal influence after birth through genetically defined maternal behaviors (Weaver et al. , 2004).",

Maternal effects can account for a large proportion of phenotypic variance, especially during early life, and for some traits explain more variation than direct genetic effects [33, 97, 99, 100, 102\u2013115]. However, maternal and offspring genotype are correlated (i.e. half their genes are shared), and in inbred lines they are fully confounded, thus separating the effects of their respective genotypes is difficult. To remove this confounding effect cross-fostering has been used, both in the laboratory and in the field [119, 131].",

      "Family Structure  The first re-identification method (FAMILY) employs genealogical data accompanying genomic data.Genealogies, rich in depth and structure, permit the construction of complex familial relationships.Consider a simple family structure of two parents and one child.Since the parental genders are guaranteed, there exist 2 variants of this structure, since the child's gender is either male or female.When disease status is taken into account, it is represented as a Boolean variable; either an individual afflicted or not afflicted.In this aspect, all three family members can be represented as three attributes {Father, Mother, Child}, and there exist (father's disease status)*(mother's disease status)*(child's disease status)*(child's gender) = 2*2*2*2 = 16 possible family-disease combinations.In reality, pedigrees are much more robust than a simple nuclear family.For example, a three-generation family of two children per family permits on the order of 10 5 distinct variants of the family-disease structure and 10 6 individuals that could be uniquely characterized.The number of combinationsk is larger when supplementary information, such as living status or medical/genetic features, is considered. 16e ability to determine unique family structures is only one part of the re-identification process.These structures must be linked to identifiable information, which, in many instances, is publicly available in the form of various genealogical databases.These databases are accessible both offline and via the World Wide Web.For example, genealogical records are available in many public databases, including ,Ancestry.com>,,Infospace.com>,,RootsWeb.com>,,GeneaNet.com>,,FamilySearch.org>, and ,Genealogy.com>. {From such data, it is not difficult to construct family structures and, with such information in hand, an adversary can link disease-labeled family structures to named individuals.",

      "Because mtDNA is not subjected (as far as we know) to sexual recombination and crossover at the time of nuclear meiosis, nature must call on other means to ensure that inevitable germ plasm mtDNA mutations (Medvedev, 1981) are not transmitted.These mutations among primary oocytes, on the face of it, can be expected to increase with time, that is with maternal age.Empirical data on this question are incomplete and conflicting, being mostly confined so far to searches for deletions rather than point mutations (Chen et al., 1995;Keefe et al., 1995).It is inevitable, however, that there will be such mutations and that there must therefore be a reliable physiological mechanism (a) for giving an opportunity for back-mutations to occur, (b) for selecting in favor of those back-mutations (thus preserving the genome) and in favor of rare advantageous mutations, and (c) for preventing the spread of persistent harmful mutations through the population -mutations that are too slight (or too late in origin) to have escaped intraovarian culling.The sheer conservation of the mitochondrial genome over 0.5 billion years or more, despite a mutation rate estimated at 10 -20 times that of nuclear DNA, is ample reason to conclude that such a physiological purification process must exist.",

      "Although bilateral descent is the norm in Western societies, it is not universal and there is variation with cultural practices around lineage.In certain societies, individuals place greater importance on (and have greater knowledge about) one side of the family than another (unilineal descent).Thus, individuals in patrilineal groups trace relationships through males only so that your father's brother's children are members of your family, but not your father's sisters (Kottak, 2007).They are members of their husband's group or family.Efforts to create a family pedigree may be hampered if the participant is not familiar with her mother's relatives, but her mother's brother's children (her cousins) may be able to supplement her overall family history.Knowledge about the cultural system of unilineal descent avoids assuming the universality of bilateral descent.Cultural beliefs such as these also have implications in the conduct of genetic research in terms of confidentiality and autonomy (Benkendorf et al., 1997;Wertz, 1997).One cannot assume that the named proband is in a position to speak for the extended family in agreeing to participate in any genetic research (DudokdeWit et al., 1997).",

The initial F1 (filial generation 1) mice are true hybrids, with each individual  From: Molecular Biomethods Handbook, 2nd Edition.",
      "These candidate genes are then sequenced in the two parental inbred strains looking for sequence di\u00a1erences in coding or regulatory regions. After \u00a2ne mapping the QTL interval and shortening the list of plausible candidate polymorphisms, the major challenge remains \u2401 proving de\u00a2nitively which nucleotide polymorphism underlies the QTL. The most direct proof would be replacing one strain\u2019s allele with another strain\u2019s allele (creating a FIG. 1. Intercross breeding strategy for mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs). On the right, the parental, F1 hybrid, and intercross (F2) mouse generations are depicted.",
      "QTL mapping studies then seek to detect the polymorphisms underlying the complex traits of interest by scanning for alleles that co-vary with the traits. Similar experiments also can be conducted with special derivatives of inbred strains known as recombinant inbred (RI) mice. These animals are derived by cross-breeding two or more distinct parental strains (which often diverge widely for the trait of interest), followed by inbreeding of the offspring for several generations (Bailey 1971). Given the correct breeding strategy, this method 1  This is an issue faced by GWASs researchers when classifying samples as cases or controls."
