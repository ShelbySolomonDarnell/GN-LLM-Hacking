    "Apoptosis, also known as cell suicide or programmed cell death, is a biological process in multicellular organisms that allows specific cells to be removed during the development of complex tissues, or potentially dangerous damaged cells to be destroyed for the benefit of the whole organism. It is characterized by a sequence of well-defined events resulting in cell destruction and is necessary for normal cell turnover. It is also essential to various other biological processes.",
    "For mammals, DNA can be extracted using a DNA Isolation Kit for Mammalian Blood, following the manufacturer's instructions. This process typically involves mixing blood with lysis buffer and Proteinase K, followed by the addition of isopropanol and Inhibitor Removal Buffer. The DNA is then washed, centrifuged, and the supernatant discarded. The remaining pellet, which contains the purified genomic DNA, is diluted in TE buffer.\n\nFor plants, the mixed alkyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (MATAB) procedure can be used. This involves grinding plant material in liquid nitrogen, incubating it in extraction buffer, and then purifying it with chloroform:isoamylalcohol. The DNA extracts are then precipitated with isopropanol and resuspended in a buffer. The extracts are further purified on anion exchange columns.",
    "A genetic marker is a measurable polymorphic sequence of DNA whose chromosomal location is known. They often have no known functional significance but are used as pointers to a particular chromosomal location. They are used to track the inheritance of genes and can be a gene or some section of DNA with no known function.",
    "The process of finding a genetic marker followed by a quantitative trait loci (QTL) involves several steps. First, a population is developed for genetic mapping. This population can be a segregating population or a permanent population. The population is then genotyped using molecular markers. Next, the population is phenotyped for an interested trait. QTL analysis is then conducted using statistical procedures to find markers linked to the QTL. This involves single-marker regression across all chromosomes, where a hypothetical QTL is evaluated at the location of each marker locus. The significance of that QTL is estimated from a likelihood ratio statistic. A permutation test is then conducted to establish genome-wide significance criteria for the trait. The result is a list of marker loci that show a significant association with the trait. These loci are most likely to be near QTLs. The goal of QTL mapping is to identify regions of the genome that harbor genes relevant to a specified trait.",
    "1. Start with an initial linkage or association: This is the first step in a genetic study where a trait or disease is linked to a specific region of the genome.\n\n2. Perform Laboratory Genotyping: This involves determining the genetic variation of an individual by examining their DNA sequence using biological assays and comparing it to a standard sequence.\n\n3. Use Genomic Sequence: The role of genomic sequence is crucial at every stage. It serves as a common thread that ties all the stages together.\n\n4. Establish True Orthology: Determine the true orthology between genes in different species. If two genes are truly orthologous, their evolution closely follows patterns of speciation.\n\n5. Apply Bioinformatics: Use bioinformatics tools and techniques to analyze the data. This can be applied to sequence data from any collection of organisms.\n\n6. Understand Genome Structure and Content: Provide an overview of genome structure and content to provide a context for subsequent discussions.\n\n7. Improve DNA Sequencing Methods: Constantly work on improving DNA sequencing methods with the ultimate goal of sequencing a human genome in a single day for a cost of about US $1,000.\n\n8. Interpret the Information: The major challenge ahead is the interpretation of this information. Understand how our genes interact with each other, and how the environment contributes to the development of health and disease.\n\n9. Consider the Implications: Understand the individual and societal implications of knowing our genome sequence.\n\n10.

    "The length of telomeres is significant as it is associated with aging, disease, and mortality. Longer telomeres are generally associated with better health outcomes, including protection from age-related diseases, better cognitive function, and healthier lipid profiles. Shorter telomeres, on the other hand, have been linked to higher risks of heart disease, infection-related death, and other diseases. Telomere length can also be influenced by factors such as stress, with high-stress situations potentially leading to faster telomere shortening and premature aging.",
    "The traits are determined by the combination of genes from both the sperm and the egg. This process involves meiosis, where each gamete (sperm and egg) contributes one chromosome to each pair, resulting in a zygote with a full complement of 23 chromosome pairs. The process of recombination or crossing over, where similar DNA sequences from the paired chromosomes swap genetic material, also plays a crucial role in determining the traits of the offspring. This results in a shuffling of genetic material and contributes to the genetic variation seen among offspring.",
    "Genetic tracing is matrilineal due to the inheritance of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which is passed from mother to all her children without any admixture from the father. This allows for a clear lineage tracing through the maternal line. In contrast, Y-DNA is passed from father to son, allowing for patrilineal tracing, but it does not provide information about the genetic contributions of other ancestors in a family tree.",

      "INTRODUCTION  Asthma is a chronic disease of the airways defined by its symptoms, which include reversible airflow obstruction, inflammation, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness.The ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans made reference to the symptoms of asthma, and today the disease is estimated to affect 235-334 million people worldwide (44,53).",
      "  The atopic triad.Perhaps the most widely recognized pattern of co-occurrence is the one of asthma, atopic dermatitis (eczema), and allergic rhinitis (hay fever), which together are referred to as the atopic triad and characteristically present clinically in a temporal sequence known as the atopic march.Within this sequence, atopic dermatitis is typically the first component to manifest, with approximately 20-30% of individuals with mild disease and 70% of those with severe disease going on to develop asthma.Individuals who undergo this distinctive sequence of disease progression frequently exhibit a more severe and persistent phenotype, with increased risk of allergen sensitization.",
      "  Clinically, asthma is characterized by episodes of coughing, chest tightness, wheezing, dyspnea, or sputum production.Often, asthma sufferers experience a combination of these symptoms, or some symptoms more than others.Pulmonary breathing tests typically demonstrate variable airway obstruction and hyperreactivity, but may be normal, even in patients with severe and uncontrolled disease [8].Thus, the diagnosis of asthma, which is based on general clinical symptoms and variable lung function testing, is non-specific and heavily dependent on clinical history.Within the \"umbrella\" diagnosis of asthma there exists a diverse array of differing clinical phenotypes [9].For example, childhood asthma is often associated with personal and parental atopic diseases (i.e., atopic dermatitis, food allergy, eosinophilic esophagitis, allergic rhinitis), viral infections, and tobacco smoke exposure [10].Alternatively, adult-onset asthma is less associated with atopic disease [11,12], but more associated with female sex [13], sinus disease [14], and preceding respiratory infections such as pneumonia [15].In addition, adult-onset disease is often of higher severity [12,16] with a faster and more persistent decline in lung function [17].Moreover, although severe patients are found in every demographic and age group, the most common phenotype is an adult female that is older and obese [18].",
      "Introduction  An estimated 9% of children and 6% of adults in the United States have asthma [1].The total number of asthma sufferers worldwide is estimated to be over 300 million, with an additional 100 million expected to develop asthma by 2025 [2][3][4][5].Developed countries are the most affected, with some of the highest rates found in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and the Republic of Ireland [3].Asthma prevalence is rising significantly in developing countries in transition to a more Western lifestyle [3].In 2007, the cost of disease in the United States was estimated to be $56 billion in relation to medical expenses, missed days of work, and early deaths [1].The rate of asthma deaths has likely plateaued, but is still as high as 250,000 per year worldwide [6].Morbidity and mortality are particularly high in ethnic minorities living below or near the poverty line, and African American children had a death rate 10 times that of non-Hispanic white children in 2015 [7].Thus, asthma is a costly, growing health problem associated with high morbidity and mortality.",
      "Getting accurate estimates of exposures is difficult, whether this is air pollution or toxins in our food and drink, but these are important questions. Rutter: That is an important point. From the twin study data it is clear that environmental effects account for quite a lot of the variance on all the multifactorial disorders. Yet the kinds of measures that are used aren\u2019t terribly solid. They include broad thing such as socio-economic status (SES). Even where there are good measures the care taken in testing for environmental mediation is usually poor.",
      "Bronchiolitis, a disease that happens in the first year of life in many infants, is strongly associated with subsequent asthma. We ascertained it in the first years of life and have been following these people to age 25 now. For the people who had bronchiolitis and now have asthma, their parents recall much better that they had bronchiolitis than those who don\u2019t have asthma now. It is at least twice more. Extraordinarily, some of these latter parents don\u2019t recall that they took their child to the doctor in the fi rst year of life.",

Martinez: We find significantly decreased likelihood of asthma if you have a dog in a home, but not if you have a cat. The reason for this is not that I hate cats, which I do, but most likely because cats are stealth hunters, and they have to be very clean. Dogs are collective hunters and they don\u2019t care if they smell.",

      "This is most common during the rainy season when aerosols are created, which results in repeated inhalation of Bp [43, 44]. Environmental sampling studies reveal there is a positive association between the prevalence of disease and the degree of environmental contamination [7]. In addition to environmental factors, data suggests that host factors play an important role in mounting an immune response against infectious diseases [45] such as melioidosis. While healthy persons can contract melioidosis, most patients in endemic regions have an underlying predisposition [28], which suggests that the immunological status of the patient can influence disease initiation and progression [15].",
      "Sensitivity analysis  We did two sets of post-hoc sensitivity analyses to assess the effects of potential poor recall of age of onset among individuals with adult-onset asthma, and the effects of misclassification of COPD as asthma among the adultonset cases, even with exclusion of cases with a reported diagnosis of COPD, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis.First, to assure that the adult-onset cases did not include a significant proportion of childhood-onset asthma in which symptoms remitted in early life but then relapsed in adulthood, we replaced adult-onset cases with increasing proportions of randomly selected childhood-onset cases, and then tested for association at the two most significant childhood onset-specific loci.This procedure was repeated 20 times for each proportion to quantify the sampling variability (appendix pp 7-8).Second, we did two analyses in which we removed either individuals with ages of asthma onset between 46 and 65 years or adult-onset cases and controls with FEV\u2081/FVC <0\u202270.For each, we compared p values and ORs with the GWAS including all adult-onset cases (appendix pp 8-9).",

      "  Apoptosis, or controlled cell death [62], is another major stressed-cell response, and was also represented in our results (Fig. 9e).A large body of direct evidence points to apoptosis as one of the main routes of RPE degeneration in AMD [63].Induction of apoptosis upon stress is dictated by the action of master regulator p53, and it was recently shown that aging increases the activity of p53 in RPE cells and the likelihood for apoptotic cell death [64].Consistent with this evidence, we found association with pathways in Transcriptional regulation by TP53 group (Fig. 9d).In particular, Regulation of TP53 activity through methylation was among the top pathway in our association analysis (Table 1), suggesting that p53 modification by methylation and the closely related histone modifications [Protein lysine methyltransferases (PKMTs) methylate histone lysine in Fig. 9e] play important roles in RPE apoptosis regulation.In the intrinsic apoptotic pathway induced by oxidative stress, cytochrome c is released from mitochondria into the cytosol, binding and activating caspases, the main proteases central to apoptotic action.We found association in pathways involving 'inhibitor of apoptosis' (IAP) and its negative regulator 'second mitochondrial activator of caspases' (SMAC) [65], which suggests that disruption to regulatory mechanisms preventing apoptosis in RPE cells may play roles in AMD.",

      "14 Apoptosis is caused by the activation of the caspase cascade, which is initiated by two signaling routes (stress-induced death and death-domain receptor-induced death) (Domen 2001). This process can be prevented by antiapoptotic molecules, such as Bcl-2 (Domen and Weissman 2000). Direct evidence for the involvement of apoptosis in HSC number regulation came from the findings that overexpression of the anti-apoptotic gene bcl-2 led to increased numbers of Thy-1.1low, Sca-1+, c-kit+, Lin- cells, a population with long-term multi-lineage repopulation potential (Domen et al. 2000).",

First of all, expression of some apoptosisrelated genes were detected in human and/or murine HSCs (Domen 2001). Secondly, targeted disruption of some of these genes in null and dominant negative mutant mice interfered with normal apoptotic processes in HSCs. For example, overexpression of Bcl-2, a negative regulator of apoptosis, increased not only the numbers and competitive repopulation capabilities of HSCs, but also the resistance of HSCs to apoptosis induced by ionizing radiation (Domen and Weissman 2003).",
      "Apoptosis  Cell suicide, or apoptosis, is a well-studied biological phenomenon in multicellular organisms that allows specific cells to be removed during the development of complex tissues, or potentially dangerous damaged cells to be destroyed for the benefit of the whole organism.The lack of an apparent evolutionary benefit for such a process in a single-celled organism initially caused controversy about the presence of an apoptotic pathway in yeast.Today, however, a number of yeast orthologues to mammalian apoptosis genes have been discovered and apoptotic-like cell death has been linked to mating, colony formation, and aging (Buttner et al. 2006;Eisenberg et al. 2007;Frohlich et al. 2007).With respect to aging, both replicatively and chronologically aged cells that die have increased ROS and display apoptotic phenotypes (Fabrizio et al. 2004a;Herker et al. 2004;Laun et al. 2001).",

      "  When a cell harbors such severe DNA damage that it is beyond repair, it is disposed of through apoptosis.Alternatively, DNA damage can induce cellular senescence, the irreversible cessation of mitosis.Both processes are critically dependent on p53, which is known as the guardian of the genome [3] .DNA damage may also trigger autophagy, a cellular catabolic process that maintains homeostasis [4] .It should be noted that under normal conditions cells are rarely exposed to very high doses of DNAdamaging agents, which may be the explanation why we do not age and die because we run out of cells.However, aging is associated with some atrophy [1] and it is conceivable that at older ages bursts of DNA damage, for example from free radical reactions associated with inflammation, do occur and give rise to an increasingly high rate of apoptosis or cellular senescence.While there is some evidence for increased apoptosis and cellular senescence at old age, it is doubtful that under normal conditions this would lead to a significant loss of functional cells.",
      "  Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, literally eliminates cells at risk for neoplastic transformation.Senescence, by contrast, permanently arrests their growth.Both processes are controlled by the p53 tumor suppressor protein (Amundson, Myers, & Fornace, 1998;Bringold & Serrano, 2000;Hickman, Moroni, & Helin, 2002;Itahana, Dimri, & Campisi, 2001).p53 is a transcriptional regulator that both transactivates and transrepresses target genes in response to stress (Prives & Hall, 1999;Ryan, Phillips, & Voudsen, 2001).These target genes, in turn, stimulate DNA repair, transient cell cycle arrest, permanent cell cycle arrest (senescence) or cell death (apoptosis), depending on cell type, degree and type of damage, and other variables.In contrast, cells that lack normal p53 regulation or function -for example, tumor cells -tend to die in response to telomere dysfunction.Some normal human cells, on the other hand, undergo a senescence growth arrest.In either case, when present, p53 is crucial for mediating the cellular response to telomere dysfunction (Yaswen & Stampfer, 2002) (Fig. 4).",

      "  It has been known that mitochondria play a central role in the life and death of cells (Kroemer & Reed, 2000).Apoptosis was observed in developmentally arrested embryos by 72 h, but not at 24 h after FCCP treatment, despite considerable telomere attrition at this early stage, suggesting that telomere attrition occurs prior to apoptosis and may serve as an intermediate step between mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis.These results also suggest that telomere shortening may signal apoptosis (Lee et al ., 1998;Karlseder et al ., 1999).",
      "Cell Death  A form of programmed cell death, apoptosis is necessary for normal cell turnover and is essential to a plethora of other biological processes.Apoptosis can be executed via Bcl-2 activation of caspases, via signals from the death receptor on the plasma membrane, or via induction by granzyme B secreted from cytotoxic T cells (Tc cells) [35].Endonucleases and proteases are activated by active caspases, eventually leading to the death of the cell.With age, however, apoptotic activity changes.In heart [36], kidney [37], skeletal muscle [38], and Tc cells [39], increased apoptosis has been reported, perhaps contributing to loss of cellularity in these tissues.This escalation across various tissues may be attributed to the increased production of free radicals [40] and furthermore exacerbated by the accumulation of DNA damage in the aged cells [41].As the risk increases for cells to turn cancerous and dysfunctional with advancing age, increased apoptosis in aged cells is argued to be a defense strategy.In other tissues, such as the colon, apoptosis appears to decrease with age perhaps contributing to the accumulation of senescent cells and age-associated carcinogenesis [42].",
      "  The regulation and execution of apoptosis in endothelial cells is a complex process involving paracrine factors, membrane receptors, interaction of pro-and anti-apoptotic factors and cysteinyl aspartate-specific proteases (caspases).Recent studies suggest that in aging there is an imbalance in the expression of pro-and anti-apoptotic genes resulting in an enhanced apoptosis in the myocardium (19), central nervous system (24), skeletal muscle (10), lung (33), and liver (2,33).Yet, age-related alterations in the expression of pro-and anti-apoptotic genes in coronary arteries have not been elucidated.",

      "  Biological characteristics indicating initial resiliency or susceptibility of an organism include genetic profiles.As noted above, genetic markers need to have a high prevalence in the population and have a reasonably strong effect on common population health outcomes, or have an interaction effect with other health-affecting mechanisms, to be candidates for inclusion in population studies.At the moment, the only known genetic marker of clear value in a population survey is the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE), although this is likely to change in the very near future.APOE allele status is clearly related to a number of major health outcomes in older populations which are reasonably well measured in population surveys: mortality, heart disease, and cognitive functioning (Albert et al., 1995b;Corder et al., 1993;Evans et al., 1997;Ewbank, 1997;Hofman et al., 1997;Hyman et al., 1996;Luc et al., 1994;Saunders et al., 1993).Both the prevalence of alleles indicating higher risk and the size of the effect are large enough to be of importance in explaining variability in currently studied health outcomes.APOE allele status has been shown to have independent effects on health outcomes and to interact with other life circumstances such as sex and race in its effect on health outcomes (Jarvik et al., 1995;Maestre et al., 1995;Payami et al., 1992).Incorporation of information on this genetic indicator could lead to increased knowledge of the interactive mechanisms of this genetic marker and other social and behavioral variables and thus clarify some of the mechanisms leading to population differentials in cognition, heart disease, and mortality.",
      "  As described by Hermalin (1999), if genetic markers are modeled as part of an individual's physiological structure, they can provide controls for predisposing factors that affect more proximate mid-level markers of function as well as downstream health outcomes.This potential benefit of genetic information-i.e., its power in explicating the black box of Figure 11-1-may outweigh, or at least precede, its near-term potential for discovering genetic links to chronic disease.As discussed by Weiss (1998b), the situation with chronic disease differs from single locus disorders that are inherited following well-identified Mendelian rules.In general, we cannot expect to find relationships that are even as straightforward as the APOE links to cardiovascular and Alzheimer's disease.Variation across populations, difficulty in identifying a small enough area on the chromosome to search for disease-associated genes, and the problems inherent in identifying continuous outcomes with particular genes may limit finding the connections.",

Introduction The association between a complex phenotypic trait and genetic markers on the chromosomes can be detected through statistical analysis, leading to the identification of quantitative trait loci (QTL)\u2014regions of the chromosomes that appear to be associated with the phenotype. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) are expected to be associated with the genes controlling some aspects of the phenotype.",
      "Nowadays many different cost-efficient genotyping solutions (including sequencing and Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms arrays) have opened the way to systematic genome-wide fine mapping of quantitative traits (Quantitative Trait Locus or QTL mapping). The process of QTL mapping (Figure 1) consists in searching for genome regions that influence the value of a given trait. For example, identifying a QTL for plant height means finding a DNA region at which the plants that carry a certain allele tend to be significantly higher or lower than those carrying another allele.",
      "QTLs are regions within the genome whose genetic variation modulates quantitatively a phenotype characteristic of the particular trait under study (Lynch and Walsh, 1998). Determining the association between variations in specific disease phenotypes or a trait, with variations in genotypes of a reference population can be used to locate a QTL. One of the methods used for mapping QTLs associated with complex traits is genetic markers-trait association. Genetic markers associated with certain loci can be inherited in linkage disequilibrium. Generating populations with linked loci in disequilibrium is achieved though either crosses between inbred lines, or use of the out-bred populations.",
      "Often, the first step in analysis of new trait data is single-marker regression across all chromosomes. A hypothetical QTL is evaluated at the location of each marker locus, and the significance of that QTL is estimated from a likelihood ratio statistic (LRS) (Haley and Knott, 1992). For this analysis, WebQTL automatically does a permutation test to establish genomewide significance criteria for the trait (Churchill and Doerge, 1994).",
      "One possible approach to facilitate this endeavor is to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) that contribute to the phenotype and consequently unravel the candidate genes within these loci. Each proposed candidate locus contains multiple genes and, therefore, further analysis is required to choose plausible candidate genes. One of such methods is to use comparative genomics in order to narrow down the QTL to a region containing only a few genes. We illustrate this strategy by applying it to genetic findings regarding physical activity (PA) in mice and human.",
      "Elucidation of the molecular basis of these traits has proven difficult as they are under the control of multiple genes and genetic loci. The standard approach to gene identification involves mapping by linkage analysis in experimental crosses, and this has led to the localization in the rat genome of hundreds of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) underlying trait variation (68). We refer to these loci as physiological quantitative trait loci (pQTLs).",
      "  Often, the first step in analysis of new trait data is single-marker regression across all chromosomes.A hypothetical QTL is evaluated at the location of each marker locus, and the significance of that QTL is estimated from a likelihood ratio statistic (LRS) (Haley and Knott, 1992).For this analysis, WebQTL automatically does a permutation test to establish genomewide significance criteria for the trait (Churchill and Doerge, 1994).By default, it returns a list of marker loci that show greater than sugges-tive association with the trait according to standard criteria (Lander and Kruglyak, 1995), but it will also accept user-defined criteria.Local maxima in the LRS in this list identify loci that are most likely to be near QTLs.WebQTL provides this list within a few seconds.",
      "QTLs can be identified through their genetic linkage to visible marker loci with genotypes that can be readily classified [94, 97]. As such, markers that are genetically linked quantitative trait will segregate more often with trait values, whereas unlinked markers will lack an association with the phenotype [94, 98]. The principal goal of a QTL analysis is to identify all QTLs linked to a trait and discern whether phenotypic differences are mainly due to a few loci with large effects, or many loci with small effects [98].",

Introduction The association between a complex phenotypic trait and genetic markers on the chromosomes can be detected through statistical analysis, leading to the identification of quantitative trait loci (QTL)\u2014regions of the chromosomes that appear to be associated with the phenotype. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) are expected to be associated with the genes controlling some aspects of the phenotype.",
      "The basic principle of classic QTL is trait segregation along with the markers and necessitated the availability of two or more genetically different lines corresponding with the phenotypic trait. Markers like single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and microsatellites are used for genotypic distinctions (Vignal et al. , 2002). QTL mapping is achieved in four basic steps; the first one is the measurement of variation for a trait in the individuals. It is a prerequisite to have the traits that show phenotypic variability among the individuals (inbred strains).",
      "  Often, the first step in analysis of new trait data is single-marker regression across all chromosomes.A hypothetical QTL is evaluated at the location of each marker locus, and the significance of that QTL is estimated from a likelihood ratio statistic (LRS) (Haley and Knott, 1992).For this analysis, WebQTL automatically does a permutation test to establish genomewide significance criteria for the trait (Churchill and Doerge, 1994).By default, it returns a list of marker loci that show greater than sugges-tive association with the trait according to standard criteria (Lander and Kruglyak, 1995), but it will also accept user-defined criteria.Local maxima in the LRS in this list identify loci that are most likely to be near QTLs.WebQTL provides this list within a few seconds.",

For this analysis, WebQTL automatically does a permutation test to establish genomewide significance criteria for the trait (Churchill and Doerge, 1994).",
      "Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) mapping To map QTL, we used 934 AXB/BXA genetic informative markers obtained from http://www. genenetwork.org. For all the in vitro measurements and gene expression linkage analysis, a genome-wide scan was performed using R/qtl [57]. Significance of QTL logarithm-of-odds (LOD) scores was assessed using 1000 permutations of the phenotype data [114] and the corresponding p-values reported. For the cellular phenotypes, QTL significance was reported at a genome-wide threshold corresponding to p < 0.05.",
      "Typically one may obtain a location known to derive from only one of the two parent strains that contains a chromosomal region that correlates with a trait of interest. Since the actual gene and gene product will frequently remain unknown, the region is referred to as quantitative trait locus (QTL), and is simply named for the trait itself (Alberts & Schughart, 2010). Growing sets of strain-dependent marker locations in established RI strains are continually updated in online repositories.",
      "By definition, a quantitative trait locus is a chromosomal region that contains a gene, or genes, that regulate a portion of the genetic variation for a particular phenotype (Wehner et al. 2001). The goal of QTL mapping is to identify regions of the genome that harbour genes relevant to a specified trait. QTL map locations are commonly determined by initial screening of mice with specific genetic characteristics, such as recombinant inbred strains, the F2 of two inbred strains, or recombinant congenic strains (Flint 2003).",
      "Often, the first step in analysis of new trait data is single-marker regression across all chromosomes.

For this analysis, WebQTL automatically does a permutation test to establish genomewide significance criteria for the trait (Churchill and Doerge, 1994).",
      "QTL linkage studies are conducted in order to map a region or regions of the genome which affect a continuous or quantitative trait. In agriculture, as soon as markers linked to QTL are found for economically important traits, these markers can be used for selecting individuals in breeding programmes. In human studies, the aim is often to identify markers indicating disease susceptibility. Current techniques for measuring markers are usually relatively slow and laborious. Newer DNA technology, such as SNP or single nucleotide polymorphisms (Kwok, 2001b; Patil et al.",
      "Genomic regions linked to complex traits can be identified by genetic mapping and quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis (Shehzad and Okuno 2014). 7 QTL mapping QTL mapping with molecular markers is the first strategy in genetic studies. In plant breeding, QTL mapping is an essential step required for marker-assisted selection (Mohan et al. 1997; Shehzad and Okuno 2014). The fundamental idea underlying QTL analysis is to associate genotype and phenotype in a population exhibiting a genetic variation (Broman and Sen 2009).",
      "Four steps of QTL mapping are (1) development a  W  population, (2) genotyping the population using molecular markers, (3) phenotyping the population for an interested trait, and (4) QTL analysis using statistical procedures to find  IE  markers linked to the QTL (Bernardo 2002). PR EV  Populations used for genetic mapping can be a segregating population (F2 and backcross) or a permanent population (double haploids or recombinant inbred lines). Recombinant inbred lines (RILs) are developed by selfing of individual progenies of the F2 plants until homozygosity is achieved (F7-F8).",
      "This tool allows systems genetic analysis of single genes or small sets of genes using a bottom-up approach. relations define quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Because the marker is not typically the actual site of the polymorphism, interpolative methods have been developed to estimate the distance of the QTL from the marker and the strength of the association. Using multiple-regression and model-fitting methods, the true complexity of the phenotypic variation can be modeled through the consideration of multiple loci and environmental factors as predictors [13]."

      "  In birds, where erythrocyte telomere length (ETL) is measured, the majority of species sampled have shown no sex difference (36).Nonetheless, bird telomere dynamics are complex and, as with humans, may be affected by environment and stress.For example, a longitudinal study of black-tailed gulls (Larus crassitostris) over 2-5 years found no correlation between ETL and age or sex.Rather, ETL attrition was correlated with reduced food availability and environmental stressors (55).In a captive zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) population, male and female mean telomere length decreased with increasing age of the animals, but did differ between sexes (56).As these examples illustrate, the relationship between telomere length, lifespan, and sex is likely to be complex in other vertebrates.",
      "  Comparative studies of age-related telomere attrition in other species also reveal a variety of patterns.Barrett and Richardson (36) recently summarized the comparative data available on sex differences in telomere length.They found a strong correlation between male-biased mortality and either shorter telomeres or greater telomere attrition in males across bird and mammal taxa.However, telomere length did not differ between males and females in species where females are shorter-lived than males (36), suggesting that telomere shortening is not associated with species-specific longevity in a simple linear fashion.These studies generally suffer from relatively small sample sizes and are largely cross-sectional.Further, the use of diverse assays, different tissues (eg, leukocytes in mammals vs erythrocytes in birds), and lack of standardized benchmarks for accuracy makes comparisons between studies difficult.",
      "  In some organisms, there is no clear relationship between telomere length and lifespan.Age-related telomere attrition could not be detected in Daphnia pulex (57) or sea urchin species (Strongylocentrotus franciscanus and Lytechinus variegatus) (58).Studies in C. elegans examining natural variation in telomere length and experimentally manipulated telomere length detect no correlation with lifespan (59,60), and in Drosophila, which uses a telomerase-independent mechanism for telomere maintenance, there is a similar lack of correlation between longevity and telomere length (61).Similarly, data on sex differences in age-related telomere shortening are mixed.For example, in the ant species Lasius niger, the rate of telomere shortening is more rapid in short-lived males compared to longer-lived females.But, mean telomere length does not differ between the two types of females, queens and workers, despite the fact that queens live much longer than workers (up to 28 years vs 2-3 months) (62).These findings suggest that the question of how telomere shortening affects aging across species and how sex affects telomere attrition rates are complex.",
      "  With new methodologies to assess relative telomere length by Q-PCR, studies were designed to address the impact of telomere length on aging, aging associated pathologies, and mortality.One such study has correlated shorter leukocyte telomere lengths at age 60 with a three times higher risk of heart disease and an eightfold increase in risk of infection-related death (36), thereby associating measured relative cellular aging with disease and life expectancy.In a similar way, chronic stress was shown to correlate with short leukocyte telomere length, a phenomenon attributed to higher levels of oxidative stress at the cellular level (70).More recent studies have linked telomere length in smooth muscle cells with senescence and disease severity in patients with atherosclerosis (141,150).Leukocyte telomere length was also short in a cohort of similar patients and associated with a higher risk of developing occult cardiovascular disease (71).More data are needed to understand and validate the use of leukocyte telomere length as a biomarker for cardiovascular and other diseases.",
      "  Shortening of the telomeres at the ends of chromosomes has been associated with age-related disease and mortality [16][17][18].A recent study identified a common haplotype of four SNPs in the human telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (hTERT) that is enriched in centenarians and associated with longer telomere length [19].It was also shown that centenarians and their offspring maintain longer telomeres compared with controls and that longer telomeres are associated with protection from age-related diseases, better cognitive function and lipid profiles of healthy ageing [19].",
      "  New research has indicated how social factors, such as subordination, may translate into biological effects (epel et al. 2004;Chae et al. 2014).In a now classic study, epel et al. ( 2004) examined the telomere lengths of fifty-eight healthy premenopausal women who either had a healthy child (n = 19) or were giving care to a chronically ill child (n = 39. )They measured perceived stress, years of caregiving, telomere length, and oxidative stress.They found highly statistically significant differences in telomere length between women taking care of chronically ill children and those who had healthy children.They found highly statistically significant negative correlations between telomere length and perceived stress and years of caregiving.Telomerase activity had highly statistically significant negative correlations with perceived stress and years of caregiving.Oxidative stress was highly positively correlated with perceived stress and years of caregiving.They concluded that the telomere length shortening was equivalent to 9 to 17 years of aging in the high stress group.Telomere length is considered a biomarker of aging (Finch and Kirkwood 2000).Thus, this study showed that caregiver stress had essentially aged these women 9 to 17 years compared to women who had healthy children.",
      "  The single, consistent predictor of the rate of telomere attrition shown in multiple adult and the few child longitudinal studies is the baseline measurement of telomere length at the start of each study.This suggests the importance of understanding predictors of telomere length prior to adulthood, as it determines in part the rate of change (Revesz et al. 2014a, b;Nordfjall et al. 2009).Moreover, longitudinal studies in adults have had found that telomere attrition rate is dependent on baseline telomere length independent of any phenotypic predictors of shortening, such as disease or demographic variables (Nordfjall et al. 2009), attesting to the importance of studies to evaluate risk factors for shortening prior to adulthood.",
      "  Rates of decline in childhood may be particularly relevant for later chronic disease risk as shorter telomere length has been implicated in disease progression through exposure to cellular senescence, inflammatory cytokines and adipocyte hypertrophy (Raschenberger et al. 2015;Willeit et al. 2014;Monickaraj et al. 2012;Fyhrquist et al. 2013).",
      "  Adult studies have also found a negative correlation with baseline telomere length, suggesting a negative feedback regulation of leukocyte telomere length (Farzaneh-Far et al. 2010;Aviv et al. 2009;Epel et al. 2008;Nordfjall et al. 2009).It is possible that while our follow-up period was shorter than Shalev et al. 2013 and adult studies, which had a minimum of 5 year intervals with the exception of Puterman et al. (2015) who followed for a one-year time period, there may be biological regulation of telomere length at 4 and 5 years of age such that shorter telomeres are more robustly maintained, whereas longer telomeres have greater rates of decline, over a short period of one year.It is unlikely that this relationship is due to assay error or regression to the mean given the consistency of our findings across studies.We have had similar findings of longer telomeres having greater rates of decline and shorter telomeres being maintained in our different studies (Farzaneh-Far et al. 2010;Epel et al. 2008;Puterman et al. 2015).",
      "  We found primarily maintenance and lengthening from 4 to 5 years of age in children, with minimal telomere attrition, indicating that most of the telomere loss happens in the first 4 years, plateauing by age 4. Lastly, we found close to 10 % of the variance in rate of change in children shared by mothers.While some of this shared variance is genetic, there are likely environmental factors that need to be further identified that impact rate of telomere length change.",
      "  Abstract Telomeres are the protective complexes at the end of chromosomes, required for genomic stability.Little is known about predictors of attrition in young children or the relationship between parental and child patterns of telomere change.Telomere length was assessed twice over one year, at 4 and at 5 years of age, in Latino preschool children (n = 77) and their mothers (n = 70) in whole blood leukocytes.Maternal and child rates of attrition during the same time period were compared in 70 mother-child pairs.More children showed lengthened telomeres over one year compared to their mothers and very few children showed attrition (2.6 %).Approximately 31 % of children and 16 % of mothers displayed lengthening over one year while 66 % of children showed maintenance in contrast with 74 % of mothers.The strongest predictor for child telomere length change was child's baseline telomere length (r = \u22120.61,p < 0.01).Maternal rate of change was associated with child rate of change (r = 0.33, p < 0.01).After controlling for child baseline telomere length, the relationship between child and maternal rate of change trended towards significance (Coeff = 0.20, 95 % CI \u22120.03 to 0.43; p = 0.08).",
      "  Blackburn and Epel, a health psychologist who did original research on how specific lifestyle and psychological habits can protect telomeres, published The Telomere Effect (Blackburn & Epel, 2017), in which they suggested that individuals with shorter telomeres developed diseases earlier in life (a shorter \"disease span\").What follows is the evidence from these authors, their colleagues, and other researchers describing how length of telomeres contributes to mind-body connection and healthy longevity.",
      "  As early as at the time of birth, each of the 92 telomeres of the human genome has its own characteristic length.Additionally, each telomere shortens by its individual attrition rate.In general, longer telomeres at birth are associated with higher age-dependent attrition rates and vice versa.Overall, telomere shortening appears more dynamic in males.",
      "  In conclusion, a combination of overall and chromosomespecifi c shorter telomeres and more pronounced age-dependent telomere erosion could be observed in males.There is a prospective clinical study strongly suggesting that longer telomeres decrease the risk of dying (Cawthon et al., 2003).With this in mind, the telomere length discrepancies between the sexes may indeed be a factor infl uencing the differences in their life expectancy.",
      "  In every chromosome a linear decline of telomere length with age was observed, being more pronounced in men independent of the examined chromosome arm.This might suggest that telomere length on single chromosome arms may be infl uenced by the same factors which determine overall telomere length.",

      "  To date, these characteristics in telomere lengths could not be set in a biological context, as only a few groups have provided detailed information about chromosome-specifi c patterns of telomere distribution (Lansdorp et al., 1996;Graakjaer et al., 2003).Whether accumulation of short telomeres (Martens et al., 2000;Londono-Vallejo et al., 2001) or rather the shortest telomere of one specifi c chromosome arm (Hemann et al., 2001) elicits senescence, remains an open question so far.",
      "  In recent literature, there are hints that the average telomere length may be higher in women and that their annual shortening rate may be somewhat lower (Vaziri et al., 1993;Rufer et al., 1998;Jeanclos et al., 2000), but these reported differences failed to reach statistical signifi cance except for one study (Jeanclos et al., 2000).Here, we provide compelling evidence that this is indeed the case.",
      "  It is generally accepted that telomeres shorten during DNA replication both in vitro and in vivo.In individuals, short telomeres are considered to be a sign of advanced age.Cawthon and coworkers (2003) showed that telomere shortening in humans likely contributes to mortality, supporting the hypothesis that they might act as a mitotic clock (Allsopp et al., 1992).Telomere length dynamics, however, does not seem to Abstract.During aging, telomeres are gradually shortened, eventually leading to cellular senescence.By T/C-FISH (telomere/centromere-FISH), we investigated human telomere length differences on single chromosome arms of 205 individuals in different age groups and sexes.For all chromosome arms, we found a linear correlation between telomere length and donor age.Generally, males had shorter telomeres and higher attrition rates.Every chromosome arm had its individual age-specifi c telomere length and erosion pattern, resulting in an unexpected heterogeneity in chromosomespecifi c regression lines.This differential erosion pattern, however, does not seem to be accidental, since we found a correlation between average telomere length of single chromosome arms in newborns and their annual attrition rate.Apart from the above-mentioned sex-specifi c discrepancies, chromosome arm-specifi c telomere lengths were strikingly similar in men and women.This implies a mechanism that arm specifi cally regulates the telomere length independent of gender, thus leading to interchromosomal telomere variations.",
      "  Shortening of the telomeres at the ends of chromosomes has been associated with age-related disease and mortality [16][17][18].A recent study identified a common haplotype of four SNPs in the human telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (hTERT) that is enriched in centenarians and associated with longer telomere length [19].It was also shown that centenarians and their offspring maintain longer telomeres compared with controls and that longer telomeres are associated with protection from age-related diseases, better cognitive function and lipid profiles of healthy ageing [19]."

      "  The reason for the rarity of these mutations is natural selection: If the mutations result in disorders that decrease health and reproductive fitness, they will eventually be eliminated from a population.In exceptional cases, mutations may cause both beneficial and detrimental consequences, resulting in opposing forces of positive selection and negative selection that may cause the mutations to be preserved at nonrare frequencies in a population.For example, the HbS mutation in the HBB gene (which produces the \u03b2 subunit of hemoglobin) causes sickle cell disease when present in both alleles, a detrimental consequence, but protects against malaria when present in 1 allele, a beneficial consequence, ensuring that the mutation persists in populations in areas of the world where malaria is endemic.Genes are passed from parents to offspring via the process of meiosis by which gametes, the egg cells in the mother and the sperm cells in the father, are generated.Ordinarily, each cell has 23 pairs of chromosomes; the gametes have 23 unpaired chromosomes.In meiosis, the 23 pairs are split so that each gamete receives 1 chromosome from each pair (Figures 8 and 9).Two gametes (egg and sperm) ultimately join into a single cell, the zygote, which has the full complement of 23 chromosome pairs restored.If all goes well, the zygote gives rise to a live offspring.",

      "Because of the small contribution, through the sperm, of the paternal transcriptome to the fertilized zygote, and because of the stronger maternal contribution to child rearing in most model organisms, parental effects are typically thought of as synonymous with maternal effects, although true paternal effects are known to exist (Rando, 2012). Maternal effects have been shown to be important during embryonic development, leading to differences in the birth weight of mice depending on the genotype of the mother (Cowley et al. , 1989; Wolf et al. , 2011).",

The most well-studied parental genetic effects are caused by deposition of maternal transcripts into the egg prior to fertilization, resulting in differences in early embryonic development depending on the genotype of the mother. Certain genes have also been shown to respond to maternal influence after birth through genetically defined maternal behaviors (Weaver et al. , 2004).",

      "Family Structure  The first re-identification method (FAMILY) employs genealogical data accompanying genomic data.Genealogies, rich in depth and structure, permit the construction of complex familial relationships.Consider a simple family structure of two parents and one child.Since the parental genders are guaranteed, there exist 2 variants of this structure, since the child's gender is either male or female.When disease status is taken into account, it is represented as a Boolean variable; either an individual afflicted or not afflicted.In this aspect, all three family members can be represented as three attributes {Father, Mother, Child}, and there exist (father's disease status)*(mother's disease status)*(child's disease status)*(child's gender) = 2*2*2*2 = 16 possible family-disease combinations.In reality, pedigrees are much more robust than a simple nuclear family.For example, a three-generation family of two children per family permits on the order of 10 5 distinct variants of the family-disease structure and 10 6 individuals that could be uniquely characterized.The number of combinationsk is larger when supplementary information, such as living status or medical/genetic features, is considered. 16e ability to determine unique family structures is only one part of the re-identification process.These structures must be linked to identifiable information, which, in many instances, is publicly available in the form of various genealogical databases.These databases are accessible both offline and via the World Wide Web.For example, genealogical records are available in many public databases, including ,Ancestry.com>,,Infospace.com>,,RootsWeb.com>,,GeneaNet.com>,,FamilySearch.org>, and ,Genealogy.com>. {From such data, it is not difficult to construct family structures and, with such information in hand, an adversary can link disease-labeled family structures to named individuals.",

The levels of complexity observed here (e.g. 14 loci explaining 70% of the genetic variance for 4-NQO resistance) are still dramatically lower than those seen in for some human traits in GWAS (e.g. 40 loci explaining 5% of the variance for height 2,5). One obvious explanation is the difference in experimental designs (line crosses vs. population association studies), but differences in genetic architectures among species and traits may also contribute.",
      "The method uses two pieces of information: mapping data from crosses that involve more than two inbred strains and sequence variants in the progenitor strains within the interval containing a quantitative trait locus (QTL). By testing whether the strain distribution pattern in the progenitor strains is consistent with the observed genetic effect of the QTL we can assign a probability that any sequence variant is a quantitative trait nucleotide (QTN). It is not necessary to genotype the animals except at a skeleton of markers; the genotypes at all other polymorphisms are estimated by a multipoint analysis.",

      "Genotyping all the individual progeny for markers that show allelic variation between the parental strains (either single nucleotide polymorphisms or simple sequence repeats) will allow the detection of associations between trait values and marker genotype, and in this way demonstrate to which set of markers a QTL is linked. To reduce the genotyping effort, selective genotyping of the individuals at the extremes of the phenotypic spectrum can be performed (20,23). Although these three approaches are in general considered to be the best to detect and map QTL, they have several disadvantages for quantitative traits involving HSC.",
      "So, how do you go about planning and performing a QTL study, and how do you identify the responsible gene within a QTL that you have identified? Generally, one starts by performing a strain survey to find two parental inbred strains that have a markedly different trait. One can now look up many different traits of inbred mice online at the Mouse Phenome Database (http://phenome. jax.org/pub-cgi/phenome/mpdcgi?rtn=docs/home). However, the trait you may want to study may not be present in wild type mice, so you may want to cross a mutant (or genetically engineered) strain onto several inbred strains.",
      "QTL Theory and Planning The theory behind the most basic form of QTL mapping is based upon intercrossing two inbred strains. The mouse genome consists of 19 pairs of autosomes (non sex-determining chromosome) and the X and Y chromosomes. In the example shown in Fig. 18.1, we are intercrossing stain A (shown with a black chromosome pair) with strain B (shown with a white chromosome pair). The initial F1 (filial generation 1) mice are true hybrids, with each individual  From: Molecular Biomethods Handbook, 2nd Edition.",
      "These candidate genes are then sequenced in the two parental inbred strains looking for sequence di\u00a1erences in coding or regulatory regions. After \u00a2ne mapping the QTL interval and shortening the list of plausible candidate polymorphisms, the major challenge remains \u2401 proving de\u00a2nitively which nucleotide polymorphism underlies the QTL. The most direct proof would be replacing one strain\u2019s allele with another strain\u2019s allele (creating a FIG. 1. Intercross breeding strategy for mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs). On the right, the parental, F1 hybrid, and intercross (F2) mouse generations are depicted.",
      "QTL mapping studies then seek to detect the polymorphisms underlying the complex traits of interest by scanning for alleles that co-vary with the traits. Similar experiments also can be conducted with special derivatives of inbred strains known as recombinant inbred (RI) mice. These animals are derived by cross-breeding two or more distinct parental strains (which often diverge widely for the trait of interest), followed by inbreeding of the offspring for several generations (Bailey 1971). Given the correct breeding strategy, this method 1  This is an issue faced by GWASs researchers when classifying samples as cases or controls."
