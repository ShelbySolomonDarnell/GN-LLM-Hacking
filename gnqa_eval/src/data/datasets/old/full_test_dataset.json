    "The text mentions two severe asthma clusters, SC2 and SC3, but does not specify individual genes. SC2 is characterized by high T2 inflammation, high FeNO, bronchoalveolar lavage and blood eosinophilia, and up-regulated expression of T2 signature and mast cell genes. SC3 is characterized by lower levels of T2 clinical biomarkers and gene expression, a later age of onset, increased incidence of nasal polyposis, and higher levels of neutrophilic inflammation.",
    "Mouse studies popular in genenetwork often focus on ailments such as diabetes, glaucoma, obesity-associated diabetes, and metabolic diseases. These studies utilize genetically modified mouse models, inbred mouse models, and polygenic models. They also use specific strains like DBA/2J, Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat, and KK mice.",
    "Yes, the studies identified significant quantitative trait loci associated with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. These include loci such as TCF7L2, DNER, SRR, HNF1A, KCNQ1, CDKN2A/CDKN2B, JAZF1, CDC123, CAMK1D, TSPAN8, LGR5, THADA, ADAMTS9, NOTCH2, and others. However, the significance of some loci varied across different populations and studies.",
    "Several environmental factors can affect mice and influence diabetes. These include the stress response, which can be greater in male mice and can confound feeding behavior, the unique gut microbiota of rodents from different production facilities, cage position, single versus group housing, the skill level of the researcher, ambient room temperature, and the type of cage bedding. Diet, particularly high-fat feeding, can also induce obesity and diabetes. Additionally, the intrauterine environment can impact the subsequent development of diabetes amongst offspring.",

    "The typical weight of a mouse liver can vary, but in the context provided, it can weigh up to 4.5 grams in a 40 gram mouse and 1.2 grams in a 20 gram normal mouse.",
    "C57BL/6 and DBA/2 mice differ in several ways. C57BL/6 mice are more accurate in tasks with greater demands and make fewer impulsive responses. They also have larger brain weights and are more resistant to radiation-induced genomic instability. DBA/2 mice, on the other hand, make fewer omission errors, respond more vigorously to certain influenza viruses, and perform better in less spatially demanding tasks. They also have larger cortical areas when adjusted for brain weight and are more sensitive to acute nephrotoxicity. Genetic differences between the two strains affect various responses including activity, memory, learning tasks, and responses to alcohol and opioids.",
    "Several behavioral QTLs have been found in mice. These include QTLs affecting aggressive behaviors, which have been identified in strains such as the Turku aggressive (TA) and non-aggressive (TNS) strains, the NC900 and NC100 strains, and the short attack latency (SAL) and long attack latency (LAL) strains. Other QTLs have been associated with traits like anxiety-related behavior, seizure, hippocampal volume, and alcohol preference. Additionally, QTLs related to alcohol, morphine or other drugs, painful arthritis, emotionality/anxiety, and seizure susceptibility have been mapped. There are also QTLs that influence exploratory behavior in mice.",
    "You can look for genes that regulate hippocampal neural stem cell proliferation in the results of gene expression profiling studies, such as the one mentioned in the text. Specifically, the study identified LRP6 as a novel regulator of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Other genes like Lef1, Mtdh, and Chchd8 may also be involved.",
    "QTL stands for Quantitative Trait Locus. It is a region of the genome that is linked to a trait and contains a gene or genes that regulate a portion of the genetic variation for a particular phenotype. QTLs are associated with quantitative traits, which are traits that have measurable phenotypic variation due to genetic and/or environmental influences."

      "  Next, the genes that correlated with FeNO (n = 549) were used to objectively cluster asthma subjects into subgroups.In agreement with Moore et al., most of the severe asthma patients clustered into 2 subject clusters (SCs) (SC2 and SC3).One severe asthma cluster (SC2) had high T2 inflammation, as evidence by a high FeNO, bronchoalveolar lavage and blood eosinophilia, and up-regulated expression of T2 signature and mast cell genes.The other severe asthma cluster (SC3) had lower levels of T2 clinical biomarkers and gene expression, in addition to a later age of onset, increased incidence of nasal polyposis and higher levels of neutrophilic inflammation.Roughly 1/2 of all asthma subjects had evidence of high T2 inflammatory response (by clinical biomarkers and gene expression), confirming the prior findings of Woodruff et al. in a more severe and steroid-treated patient population.In general, both severe asthma clusters (SC2 and SC3) were older and more obese than the other non-severe subclusters.Further, both of the severe SCs demonstrated suppression of genes associated with cilia function, neuronal function, cell adhesion and wound repair.These findings suggested that airway epithelial defense, repair, neuronal function are an integral part of a healthy epithelial layer and perhaps prevention of severe asthma.",

      "A major advantage of the mouse as an animal model is the availability of well-characterized inbred strains that enable functional genomics on defined genetic backgrounds. Currently, however, exploiting the full utility of mice to study human diseases is hampered by the lack of gene targeting resources for multiple inbred mouse strains.

      "  Polygenic models of obesity.Polygenic models of obesity may provide a more accurate model of the human condition.A variety of different polygenic mouse models of obesity, glucose intolerance and diabetes exist, allowing a variety of genotypes and susceptibilities to be studied.However, unlike the monogenic models, there are no wild-type controls.In addition, the male sex bias is more extreme in these models (Leiter, 2009).These polygenic models have been used in a wide variety of studies that have aimed to reverse the symptoms of type 2 diabetes (Chen et al., 2009;Fukaya et al., 2009;Guo et al., 2010;Mochizuki et al., 2011;Yoshinari and Igarashi, 2011), understand more about the interplay of obesity and glucose homeostasis (Kluth et al., 2011) (Jurgens et al., 2007) or study diabetic complications (Cheng et al., 2007;Fang et al., 2010;Buck et al., 2011;Lee et al., 2011a).KK mice.KK mice are a mildly obese and hyperleptinaemic strain derived from wild-derived ddY mice in Japan by Kondo in 1957 (Clee and Attie, 2007).They develop severe hyperinsulinaemia and demonstrate insulin resistance in both muscle and adipose tissue.The pancreatic islets are hypertrophic and degranulated.This mouse strain also shows signs of diabetic nephropathy (Ikeda, 1994).",

Similar to humans, inbred strains of mice exhibit differences in their susceptibility to diabetes, renal and cardiovascular diseases (Krolewski et al. , 1996). More recently, differential susceptibilities to DN have also been observed in well-defined strains of  23",
      "  The third advantage of the mouse model is that after identification of a candidate gene, direct genetic evidence for its involvement in a pathophysiology can be obtained in mice, but very rarely in humans.Thus, inbred mouse models are ideally suited for the investigation of the obesity-associated diabetes.However, the genetic homogeneity of the inbred strains is not only an advantage, it also limits their potential.Individuals of an inbred mouse line are genetically identical, and it cannot be expected that a single strain carries more than a small portion of all relevant gene variants.Currently, more than 2000 mouse QTL for different traits have been identified in crosses between inbred stains, but only about 1 % has been characterized on molecular level (Flint et al. 2005).Thus, more than one model and new resources, e.g., systems biology may be required for a complete genetic analysis of complex traits.Previous and ongoing research supports the view that the combination of individual genomes-by intercross of inbred strains and by the generation of congenic lineswill reveal effects of many more genes and gene interactions than can be observed in a single inbred strain.Because the cross-breeding experiments are time consuming and expensive, selecting the ''right'' models of the obesity-associated diabetes is of crucial importance (Leiter 2009).Another advantage of mouse studies in comparison to human studies is the ability to control the environment and to investigate effects of diets, exercise, and intestinal microbiota.",
      "Introduction Rodents, particularly mouse and rat have been widely used for biomedical research in models of human diseases since it is known that almost of all of genes in mouse and rat are similar to that of humans. However, not every genetic pathway or molecular mechanism of diseases or drugs discovered to be efficacious in these models can be extrapolated to human diseases. Thus, while much data from animal studies have been successfully applied to humans, some have not. The present study aims to explore the degrees of differences in the causal pathways for lung fibrosis between humans and mice.",
      "  These limitations support the increasing need of experimental systems to characterize the fundamental biological mechanisms responsible for diabetes inheritance and the function of risk genes.In the context of diabetes pathogenesis, in vitro systems are useful but often limited, in particular to assess glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, islet architecture and function and diabetes complications.The laboratory mouse provides a wide range of experimental models for diabetes gene discovery and for in vivo post-GWAS studies of diabetes that develops either spontaneously or following gene editing [5].The laboratory rat is also a powerful system to implement phenotyping methods required to record biological variables relevant to common chronic diseases.The rat is the preferred model to perform phenotyping procedures that are often technically challenging in mice or require the collection of large volumes of blood or organs.For these reasons, rat models of type 2 diabetes or hypertension have been successfully used to localise in the genome genes controlling endophenotypes relevant to these complex diseases.This review addresses strategies used to map the genetic determinants of physiological and molecular phenotypes relevant to type 2 diabetes pathogenesis and to characterize their biological function in vivo through examples derived from genetic and genomic research in the Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat strain.",
      "However, many of the phenotypes of the homozygous null mutations were extreme and/or did not model the complexity of the metabolic syndrome. For example, IR knockout (IR2/2) mice died because of developmental effects (Accili et al. , 1996), which precluded analysis of adult mice. Likewise, GLUT42/2 mice exhibited only moderate insulin resistance and were not overtly diabetic, suggesting compensatory mechanisms (Katz et al. , 1995). Monogenic GEMMs furthermore ignore the polygenic nature of metabolic diseases, resulting from genetic and environmental factors impacting at multiple levels in signaling cascades. Oligogenic mouse models remedied some of these shortcomings.",

Genetic reference populations (GRPs) Perhaps the most \u2018\u2018refreshing\u2019\u2019 mouse resource for investigating complex diseases is the construction of mouse crosses using inbred mice and the subsequent QTL mapping. Inbred mice have an inherent wealth of variation due to past spontaneous mutation events, which have been preserved through systematic and uninterrupted brother-sister matings (Paigen, 2003). Inbred mice are appealing since they are genetically identical within a strain but are diverse between strains.",

      "Rodent models of glaucoma have gained favor in the research community due to their ease of handling and the lower costs associated with acquisition and care. In particular, the mouse provides a number of useful genetic approaches to create models and to test specific molecular interactions associated with the disease process. Furthermore, the mouse genome is relatively conserved compared to the human genome.",
      "Better Mouse Models. A key point to bear in mind in assessing the usefulness of mouse models is the relative plasticity displayed by rodents faced with gene deletions.Thus, differences between the penetrance of mutations in human genes linked to monogenic forms of diabetes, including maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY), between humans and mice, are usually observed [114] with the mouse equivalents showing far less marked disturbances in glycemia or changes which are seen only after deletion of both alleles.This clearly reflects the limitations of the use of mice (weight \u223c25 g, life expectancy \u223c3 years) for comparisons with human subjects.Nonetheless, and although the phenotypes of the above murine models are thus often more subtle than the human counterparts, they remain useful models for the study of diabetes, allowing single-targeted gene deletions which are impossible in man.For example, human populations with different genetic backgrounds have different susceptibility to the R235W ZnT8 polymorphism.We should not, therefore, find surprising the results that different genetic backgrounds and different diet reveal different phenotypes in ZnT8 knockout models."

      "  Additional large-scale meta-analysis predicated upon increased sample size, were carried out on existing datasets from the WTCCC [18] and the Genetics of Kidneys in Diabetes (GoKinD) study [69][70][71] plus control data derived from the National Institute of Mental Health.These investigators observed significant association of previously observed loci.Importantly, they did not observe evidence of new T1D loci reaching the threshold for genome-wide significance.Instead they re-analyzed the most nominally significant associated SNP in an independent British cohort of approximately 6000 cases, 7000 controls and in 2800 families, where they uncovered four additional loci, BACH2 (previously reported [67]), 10p15 harboring protein kinase C theta (PRKCQ), 15q24 harboring nine genes including the cathepsin H (CTSH), complement 1q (C1q), tumor necrosis factor related protein 6 (C1QTNF6) and somatostatin receptor 3 (SSTR3) genes.Table 1 summarizes the 16 T1D loci reported to date.An example of a tag-SNP that captures the association with T1D in each instance is highlighted together with its relative minor allele frequency in controls and what magnitude of risk or protection it confers.Key references regarding the role of each locus in the context of the disease are included and along with the chromosomal band where each locus resides, the main candidate gene (symbol and full name) is highlighted.",
      "Detection of established loci  We explored the extent to which previously reported type 2 diabetes association signals could be detected in African-descent individuals.Based on the previously reported effect sizes and the effect allele frequency and sample size from our African meta-analysis, we had sufficient power (80%) to detect three signals (TCF7L2, DNER and SRR) at genome-wide significance (p < 2.5 \u00d7 10 \u22128 ) (ESM Table 2).Only the TCF7L2 variant reached genome-wide significance in our study, whereas both variants in DNER (rs1861612) and SRR (rs391300), originally discovered in Pima Indians and East Asians, respectively, had p > 0.1 (ESM Table 2).",
      "  On the basis of the combined stage 1-3 analyses, we found that six signals reached compelling levels of evidence (P \u00bc 5.0 \u00c2 10 -8 or better) for association with T2D (Table 2).As in all linkage disequilibrium (LD)-mapping approaches, characterization of the causal variants responsible, their effect sizes and the genes through which they act will require extensive resequencing and fine-mapping.However, on the basis of current evidence, we found that the most associated variants in each of these signals map to intron 1 of JAZF1, between CDC123 and CAMK1D, between TSPAN8 and LGR5, in exon 24 of THADA, near ADAMTS9 and in intron 5 of NOTCH2.",

      "  Although these are considered to be loci convincingly associated with susceptibility to type 2 diabetes in populations of European descent, other genes related to susceptibility to the disease are probably still unidentified, particularly those for populations of other ancestries.In order to uncover genetic variants that increase the risk of type 2 diabetes, we conducted a genome-wide association study in Japanese individuals with type 2 diabetes and unrelated controls.We first genotyped 268,068 SNPs, which covered approximately 56% of common SNPs in the Japanese, in 194 individuals with type 2 diabetes and diabetic retinopathy (case 1) and in 1,558 controls (control 1) collected in the BioBank Japan.We compared the allele frequencies of 207,097 successfully genotyped SNPs and selected the 8,323 SNPs showing the lowest P values.We then attempted to genotype these 8,323 SNPs in 1,367 individuals with type 2 diabetes and diabetic retinopathy (case 2) and for 1,266 controls (control 2) (stage 2), and successfully obtained data for 6,731 SNPs (the P value distribution in the second test is shown in Supplementary Fig. 1a online).The results of principal component analysis 8 in the stage 1 and 2 samples and HapMap samples revealed that there was no evidence for population stratification between the case and control groups throughout the present tests (Supplementary Fig. 1b,c).We selected the 9 SNP loci showing P values o0.0001 (additive model in stage 2, Table 1) and genotyped a third set of cases and controls comprising 3,557 Japanese individuals with type 2 diabetes (cases 3,4,5) and 1,352 controls (controls 3,4).We evaluated the differences in the population structure among these three sets of case and two sets of control groups by Wright's F test.As the results indicated that there was no difference in the population structure among these groups (Supplementary Table 1b online), we combined these populations for the third test of case-control study.The third set of analysis identified the significant associations for six SNPs (Table 1), including the CDKAL1 locus at 6p22.3 (rs4712524, rs9295475 and rs9460546), the IGF2BP2 locus at 3q27.2 (rs6769511 and rs4376068) and the KCNQ1 locus at 11p15.5 (rs2283228).The remaining three SNPs (rs13259803, rs612774 and rs10836097) had P values of 40.05 in the third test and were not further examined.CDKAL1 and IGF2BP2 were previously reported as susceptibility genes for type 2 diabetes in the Japanese population 9 .Therefore, we focused on the KCNQ1 locus, which was highly associated with type 2 diabetes.",
      "  We consider these data as an interesting preliminary result that surely requires additional independent studies including a higher number of patients in order to confirm and clarify the possible contribution of this locus to the development of T2DM complications.",
      "DISCUSSION  Taken together, our full second-stage approach and combined meta-analysis have revealed additional loci associated with type 1 diabetes.Clearly the risks are relatively modest compared with previously described associations, and it was only with this sample size at our disposal that we could we detect and establish these signals as true positives through an independent validation effort.",
      "Identification of susceptibility loci  The degree of evidence for all reported T2D loci was quantified as follows: a locus with a logarithm of odds ratio (LOD) score of 3 or more was considered significant, a LOD score between 2.2 and 3 was considered suggestive and a LOD score between 1 and 2.2 was considered nominal.For T2D, only those loci were included that were significant at least once, or were suggestive in at least one study and at least nominal in two or more studies.The inclusion of the second category of loci was based on a study by Wiltshire et al. [72], in which it was postulated that locus counting is a useful additional tool for the evaluation of genome scan data for complex trait loci.We used the same two criteria to determine the loci from the five papers published on obesity since 2004 and combined these loci with those from Bell et al. [7].As obesity phenotypes, BMI, serum leptin levels, abdominal subcutaneous and visceral fat, and percentage body fat were included.All of these phenotypes were used as continuous quantitative traits, as well as with various cut-off levels.",
      "  Today, more than 100 loci for type 2 diabetes and glycemic traits have been identified through numerous GWA studies of common and rare variation in populations of diverse ancestral origins [31]; however, to date, very few GWA studies have been published in cohorts of Mexican ancestry.The first GWA study performed in a non-European cohort was published in 2007 and comprised 561 Mexican American type 2 diabetes cases and controls drawn from the Starr County Health Studies [32].Although no loci reached genome-wide significance, several loci identified in prior GWA studies in Europeans were replicated [32].This analysis was subsequently expanded (N = 1273) and meta-analyzed with a cohort from Mexico City (N = 1310) in 2011 [33,34].The most significant variants observed in this meta-analysis included known regions near HNF1A and KCNQ1.Top association signals were then meta-analyzed with the DIAGRAM and DIAGRAM+ datasets of European ancestry individuals, resulting in two regions reaching genome-wide significance: HNF1A and CDKN2A/CDKN2B (Table 1).Top association signals in both studies were annotated to explore their roles as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in both adipose and muscle tissues, revealing a marked excess of transacting eQTL in top signals in both tissue types.",
      "  75\u00b179 The main conclusion is that there is no major locus for T2D (analogous to HLA in type 1 diabetes).This is not surprising given the modest l s for T2D (approximately 3.5 in Europeans), imposing a limit on the magnitude of any single gene eect. 4Many scans have consequently been signi\u00aecantly underpowered to detect the modest gene eects anticipated.Certainly, few T2D scans have reported linkages meeting the established criteria for genomewide signi\u00aecance. 80This modest power, combined with the diversity of the pedigrees sampled and the analytical techniques used, means that the replication of positive \u00aendings between data sets has been the exception rather than the rule.",
      "Quantitative Trait Analysis  Exploration of putative T2DM variants with quantitative glycemic traits in a subset of African-American samples (n = 671 from the IRAS and IRASFS control samples, Table S5) revealed     limited insight into the biological mechanism associated with T2DM risk.In addition, the five putative African-American T2DM susceptibility loci were tested for association with quantitative measures of glucose homeostasis in the European Caucasian population, in silico, by the Meta-Analyses of Glucose and Insulin-related traits Consortium (MAGIC; [16]).These results did not provide further insight into the probable role these variants may have in disease susceptibility (Table S6).The most significantly associated SNP in African Americans, rs7560163, failed quality controls filters and was not included in analysis likely due to being monomorphic as seen in a representative Caucasian population from the HapMap project (Table S4).",
      "  Discovery of novel loci for T2D susceptibility.We tested for T2D association with ~27 million variants passing quality-control filters, ~21 million of which had a minor allele frequency (MAF) < 5%.Our meta-analysis identified variants at 231 loci reaching genomewide significance (P < 5 \u00d7 10 \u22128 ) in the BMI-unadjusted analysis (N eff 231,436) and 152 in the smaller (N eff 157,401) BMI-adjusted analysis.Of the 243 loci identified across these two analyses, 135 mapped outside regions previously implicated in T2D risk (Methods, Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 2).",
      "  Genetic studies performed since 2012 have identified many additional T2D loci based on risk alleles common in one population but less common in others.Studies in African Americans identified RND3-RBM43 (28), HLA-B and INS-IGF2 (29).Studies in South Asians identified TMEM163 (30) and SGCG (31).One locus, SLC16A11-SLC16A13, was simultaneously identified in Japanese and Mexican Americans (32,33), and studies in East Asians identified ANK1 (34), GRK5 and RASGRP1 (35), LEP and GPSM1 (32), and CCDC63 and C12orf51 (36).A study of individuals from Greenland identified TBC1D4 (37), and a sequencing-based study of Danes with follow-up in other Europeans identified MACF1 (38).Finally, the largest GWAS to date in American Indians identified DNER at near genome-wide significance (P = 6.6 \u00d7 10 \u22128 ) (39).Three of these studies imputed GWAS data using the 1000 Genomes Project sequence-based reference panels, providing better genome coverage (29,32,33,40).Taken together, these studies highlight the value of diverse populations, including founder and historically isolated populations, to detect risk loci.",
      "  Finally, a recent study identified additional susceptibility loci for type 2 diabetes by performing a meta-analysis of three published GWAs. 21As acknowledged by the authors, GWAs are limited by the modest effect sizes of individual common variants and the need for stringent statistical thresholds.Thus, by combining data involving 10,128 samples, the authors found in the initial stages of the analysis highly associated variants (they followed only 69 signals out of over 2 million metaanalyzed SNPs) with P values \u03fd10 \u03ea4 in unknown loci, and 11 of these type 2 diabetes' associated SNPs were taken forward to further stages of analysis.Large stage replication testing allowed the detection of at least six previously unknown loci with robust evidence for association with type 2 diabetes.",
      "  Surprisingly, data about previous published loci associated with type 2 diabetes were not sufficiently powerful to reach a significant P value in individual scans.For example, variants at SLC30A8 and PPARG were significantly associated with type 2 diabetes only when pooling all the GWAs data, whereas in a single genome scan (DGI), no gene showed a positive signal (P value: 0.92 and 0.83, respectively).Thus, this may suggest that GWAs are still underpowered to find SNPs with small effect size.",
      " Background: The two genome-wide association studies published by us and by the Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium (WTCCC) revealed a number of novel loci, but neither had the statistical power to elucidate all of the genetic components of type 1 diabetes risk, a task for which larger effective sample sizes are needed.Methods: We analysed data from two sources: (1) The previously published second stage of our study, with a total sample size of the two stages consisting of 1046 Canadian case-parent trios and 538 multiplex families with 929 affected offspring from the Type 1 Diabetes Genetics Consortium (T1DGC); (2) the Rapid Response 2 (RR2) project of the T1DGC, which genotyped 4417 individuals from 1062 non-overlapping families, including 2059 affected individuals (mostly sibling pairs) for the 1536 markers with the highest statistical significance for type 1 diabetes in the WTCCC results.Results: One locus, mapping to a linkage disequilibrium (LD) block at chr15q14, reached statistical significance by combining results from two markers (rs17574546 and rs7171171) in perfect LD with each other (r 2 = 1).We obtained a joint p value of 1.3610 26 , which exceeds by an order of magnitude the conservative threshold of 3.26610 25 obtained by correcting for the 1536 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) tested in our study.Meta-analysis with the original WTCCC genome-wide data produced a p value of 5.83610 29 .Conclusions: A novel type 1 diabetes locus was discovered.It involves RASGRP1, a gene known to play a crucial role in thymocyte differentiation and T cell receptor (TCR) signalling by activating the Ras signalling pathway.",
      "  Finally, we examined whether genes identified using our association studies were enriched within diabetes-related pathways.We collated a list of 42 genes to which 53 CpG sites associated with T2D traits (CS score \u22651.77, combined P < 0.017) mapped.Even in this small dataset, pathway analysis (Supplementary Material, Table S12) indicated significant enrichment in 31 pathways (Fisher's exact P < 0.05), including those related to circadian clock (P = 0.005), adipocytokine signaling (P = 0.009), leptin pathway (P = 0.023), HDL-mediated lipid transport (P = 0.031) and insulin signaling (P = 0.033).",
      "  In recent years, progress has been made in following up mechanistic studies of GWAS type 2 diabetes-association signals [6,7,9,[25][26][27][28][29][30], but challenges remain in sifting through the many associated variants at a locus to identify those influencing disease.We hypothesized that a common variant with modest effect underlies the association at the CDC123/CAMK1D locus and evaluated the location of high LD variants (r 2 $.7; n = 11) at the locus relative to known transcripts and to putative DNA regulatory elements.We identified two variants that overlapped putative islet and/or liver regulatory regions and none located in exons.We did not assess variants in lower LD (r 2 ,.7), and additional functional SNPs may exist at this locus acting through alternate functional mechanisms untested in the current study.",
      "  Meta-analysis results for T2D SNPs for insulin and glucose-related traits.",
      "A r t i c l e s  By combining genome-wide association data from 8,130 individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and 38,987 controls of European descent and following up previously unidentified meta-analysis signals in a further 34,412 cases and 59,925 controls, we identified 12 new T2D association signals with combined P < 5 \u00d7 10 \u22128 .These include a second independent signal at the KCNQ1 locus; the first report, to our knowledge, of an X-chromosomal association (near DUSP9); and a further instance of overlap between loci implicated in monogenic and multifactorial forms of diabetes (at HNF1A).The identified loci affect both beta-cell function and insulin action, and, overall, T2D association signals show evidence of enrichment for genes involved in cell cycle regulation.We also show that a high proportion of T2D susceptibility loci harbor independent association signals influencing apparently unrelated complex traits."

      "  Summary of rodent models of type 2 diabetes",
      "  Since the obesity is induced by environmental manipulation rather than genes, it is thought to model the human situation more accurately than genetic models of obesityinduced diabetes.High fat feeding is often used in transgenic or knock-out models, which may not show an overt diabetic phenotype under normal conditions, but when the beta cells are 'pushed', the gene may be shown to be of importance.It should be noted that the background strain of the mice can determine the susceptibility to diet-induced metabolic changes, and thus, effects could be missed if a more resistant strain is used (Surwit et al., 1995;Bachmanov et al., 2001;Almind and Kahn, 2004).It has also been reported that there is heterogeneity of the response to high fat feeding within the inbred C57BL/6 strain, indicating that differential responses to a high-fat diet are not purely genetic (Burcelin et al., 2002).",
      "Other considerations and limitations  A myriad of factors affect animal experiments.Men elicit a greater stress response in mice than women 292 , likely confounding feeding behaviour.Rodents from different production facilities (for example, Jackson Laboratory and Taconic) have unique gut microbiotas 293 , perhaps contributing to differences in their susceptibility to DIO and related diabetic complications 293 .Similarly, cage position within a rack of cages, single versus group housing, the skill level of the researcher, ambient room temperature or the type of cage bedding can all affect experimental outcomes.",
      "  We believe there are several factors that researchers should consider when conducting obesity and diabetes mellitus research in rodents (FIG.2).Although our list is by no means an exhaustive, it demonstrates the complexity and interconnectedness of the myriad of factors that can confound experimental outcomes.Although it is impossible to control for everything, researchers should accurately detail all experimental conditions and methods to allow for better interpretation of the results and, importantly, for better reproducibility.",
      "  Figure2| Important experimental parameters and potential confounders of experimental outcomes in obesity and diabetes research and their interrelatedness.Countless factors influence experimental outcomes when using animal models, and what is enumerated here is by no means a complete list.This figure is one depiction of the multifactorial and interconnected genetic and environmental matrix that makes it virtually impossible to design the perfect experiment.For example, single-housing mice to obtain more accurate food intake data introduces a stress that in turn affects food intake.The severity of this stress response is both strain-specific and sex-dependent.What is important is to be aware of these challenges and to control for them in the most optimal manner.It is equally, if not more, important to accurately and comprehensively detail all experimental conditions in research papers, as these have bearing on the interpretation and reproducibility of the published results.DIO, diet-induced obesity.",
      "  Another concern pertains to control mice.Compared with free-living mice in the wild, laboratory control mice with ad libitum access to food are sedentary, overweight, glucose intolerant and tend to die at a younger age 297 .Comparisons between mice with DIO and control mice might be analogous to investigating the genetic cause of obesity-resistance by comparing humans who are overweight or obese.This potential problem with control mice could explain why the use of DIO diets that have 40% to 60% of total energy from fat is so prevalent, as this might be necessary to achieve divergent weight gains.With free access to running wheels, C57BL/6J mice voluntarily run 5-10 km per day 298,299 .As is the case with humans 300 , mice get health benefits from regular physical activity including weight loss, decreased adiposity and improved insulin sensitivity 301,302 .Physical activity might also affect the epigenome over several generations 303 .An enriched physical and social cage environment alone improves leptin sensitivity and energy expenditure in mice, independent of physical activity 304,305 .Overall, these data suggest that with standard mouse husbandry, chow-fed laboratory mice are not the ideal healthy and lean control group for meaningful obesity research.",
      "  To better address these points, various animal models have been developed.For example, using HFD-T2DM male rats, the F1 female offspring showed reduced \u03b2 cell area and insulin secretion, together with glucose intolerance, without changes in body weight [145].The islets of the F1 female offspring showed differential expression of many genes involved in Ca 2+ , mitogen-activated protein kinase and Wnt signaling, apoptosis and cell cycle regulation [145].Similarly, in pregnant C57BL6J mice, food deprivation resulted in \u03b2 cell mass reduction and an increased risk of \u03b2 cell failure in offspring [146].",

      "Phenotypes are often very different between mouse strains with diverse genetic backgrounds and the strain characteristics of DBA/ 2J are often contrasted with other genetically distinct inbred strains such as C57BL/6J. These defined genetic backgrounds provide an excellent system for mapping modifier genes [20,21,22]. To study these differences a number of DBA/2J-relevant resources have been generated. For instance, a genome-wide panel of congenic strains has been created that contain portions of DBA/2J chromosomes on a C57BL/6J background [23]. These 65 strains contain more than 95% of the DBA/2J genome.",

      "Particularly striking is the difference in their locomotor response: the C57BL/6J strain shows a marked locomotor activation following an acute opiate administration, which is virtually absent in DBA/2 mice [6, 25, 29]. After chronic morphine treatment, either tolerance or sensitization of the locomotor response was evidenced in C57BL/6J mice, depending on the treatment paradigm, whereas no altered responses were observed in the DBA/2J strain [1, 22, 29, 31]. Other inter-strain differences in reactions to opioids have also been reported, including a greater sensitivity to opioid reward and stronger withdrawal symptoms in the C57BL/6J strain [2, 6, 17, 30, 35].",

This suggested the contribution of multiple genetic loci to these phenotypes, of which we detected a significant one on chromosome 16 for response variability.",
      "Given the large differences that we found previously (Crusio 2013) between C57BL/6 and DBA/2, this is unexpected. One possible explanation for the lower than expected performance of the C57BL/6 and (at least some) BXD strains lies in the housing conditions. Our animal facility was built to house about 500 cages in one large breeding room. However, the cage-washing installation (and the available personnel) could not handle that many cages at a time. As a result, every day one or two racks of cages were changed. C57BL/6 mice are sensitive to such disruptions and, indeed, breeding results were only mediocre.",
      "C57BL/6 and DBA/2 mice is not yet fully understood but involves multiple genetic differences between the two mouse lineages, affecting several pathways and processes (1). Certain influenza viruses grow to higher titers in DBA/2 mice (A/Hong Kong/213/2003 [H5N1] or A/Memphis/33/2008 [H1N1]) (data not shown) while others do not (H7N3 and H10N5) (this study). Irrespective of the difference in viral loads, DBA/2 mice respond more vigorously, producing larger quantities of certain proinflammatory molecules like TNF-\u2423, which was shown to correlate with increased morbidity and mortality in humans (5).",

For this QTL study, C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice were used as resistant and sensitive strains, respectively. Each strain has a complete genomic sequence available, and the genetic basis of differences in their ability to respond to xenobiotics is extensively studied (reviewed in Ref. 8).",

The BXD family consists of more than 150 BXD fully inbred strains that segregate for \u223c6 million genetic variants and thus can be used as an informative murine genetic reference panel.",
      "Because we have now shown that the parental strains C57BL/6J and DBA/2J markedly differ in both quantitative measures of cortex area size [6] and shape, this assures variation in the derivative BXD lines, and provides an empirical basis for using the BXD panel to study cortical development. Conclusion C57BL/6J and DBA/2J have markedly different cortical area maps, in both size and shape. These differences suggest polymorphism in genetic factors underlying cortical specification, even between common isogenic strains. Comparing cortical phenotypes between normally varying inbred mice or between genetically modified mice can identify genetic contributions to cortical specification.",
      "The C57BL/6 mice were more accurate than DBA/2 mice at the shorter SD where the task demands were greater, and they also made anticipatory (impulsive) responses at a lower rate. In contrast, the DBA/2 mice made fewer omission errors than the C57BL/6 but this effect was not seen until the final stages of the experimental procedures. These findings are in agreement with those of Greco et al. [18]. Although they used different breeders as well as different test chambers, training protocols and reinforcers, the results were similar: DBA/2 males were less accurate and made more anticipatory responses than C57BL/6 males.",
      "DBA/2 mice perform poorly in other spatial tasks as well as in the 5-CSRTT (see Section 1) but this is by no means true for paradigms that are less spatially demanding. For instance, in the four-arm baited and cued versions of the radial maze, as well as in auditory fear conditioning, C57BL/6 and DBA/2 do not differ [1,30]; DBA/2 mice even perform better than C57BL/6 with regard to two-way active avoidance learning [37].",

      "It can be seen that at all SD, accuracy was greater for C57BL/6 than for DBA/2 mice. The clearest difference was at 1 s SD where C57BL/6 mice were responding at a mean accuracy of 80% compared with the DBA/2 group for which the mean was 59% (Fig. 1(A)). With a SD of 5 s there was no significant main effect for group (F1,28 = 3.13), whereas at 2 and 1 s SD significant group effects were achieved (F1,28 = 5.44 and 25.1; P < 0.05 and 0.001, respectively).",
      "In marked contrast, the C57BL/6J strain was found to have the highest level of oral morphine consumption [6]. However, sensitivity to the reinforcing effects of morphine in conditioned place preference and intravenous self-administration paradigms was higher in DBA mice than in C57BL [10]. The two frequently used laboratory strains of mice C57BL/6J and DBA/2J show remarkable differences in analgesic response to morphine. Moreover, several studies have reported profound differences in morphine induced locomotor activity between the sensitive C57BL/6 and insensitive DBA/2 mice [3,7].",
      ", increased exploration of the open areas) in both tests. One explanation is that DBA/2J is \u201csusceptible\u201d to this stressor, whereas C57BL/6J is \u201cresilient.\u201d However, a more circumscribed but potentially more accurate interpretation is that both strains react strongly to this particular stress regime, but differ in the manner in which the response manifests behaviorally. Thus, DBA/2J may develop a classic \u201cpassive\u201d anxiety-like suppression of approach behavior, whereas C57BL/6J may exhibit more of an \u201cactive\u201d response to stress. This could reflect an increased panic-like escape drive or manic-like reaction to stress in C57BL/6J, rather than a decrease in anxiety-like behavior.",
      "Differences in radiation sensitivity between the BXD parental strains were first described by Roderick more than 45 years ago, with DBA/2J succumbing more quickly than C57BL/6J to a lethal dose of radiation (26). At more modest doses, C57BL/6J mice were shown to be more resistant to radiation-induced genomic instability than DBA/2J (38, 84, 85).",
      "Genetic differences between C57 and DBA mice have been shown to translate into a broad spectrum of CNS related functional and molecular correlates, for example, differences in activity, impulsive action, hippocampal related memory and learning tasks, post- and pre-synaptic protein expression, and synaptic transmission and plasticity [27\u201340]. Through genetic linkage analyses, the genetic and phenotypic differences in the BXD panel of RI strains have resulted in identification of genes and loci involved in complex CNS functions, such as impulsivity [41], reversal learning [42], attention [43], neuronal oscillations [44], hearing loss [45], and fear and spatial learning [39,40].",
      "For example, the C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA2/J (D2) inbred mice frequently are used in alcohol research because they clearly differ in various responses to alcohol, including development of functional tolerance (Grieve and Littleton 1979), locomotor activation (Phillips et al. 1998), and sensitivity to withdrawal symptoms (Metten and Crabbe 1994). Because the environmental conditions in these experiments can be controlled, any differences observed between the mouse strains in these phenotypes most likely can be attributed to genetic differences.",
      "For example, when subjected to HFD, DBA/2J had 12.5% more body fat compared to C57BL/6J (P < 0.0001, Fig 1A). Additionally, the F1 offspring generated by DBA/2J dams (DBA/2J x C57BL/6J) had 10.6% more body fat (P < 0.001) compared to the F1 from C57BL/ 2J dams (C57BL/6J x DBA/2J). While the source of these latter effects appears to be maternal, further studies are needed to identify the molecular basis of these differences. In general, genetic differences between strains impacted body weight variation throughout the experiment (P < 0.05) (Fig 1B)."

The only two genes not targeted by Lef1 can be closely associated with it: Mtdh regulates the expression of Lef1 (Hu et al. , 2009; Yoo et al."

      "QTL Mapping and Identification of Candidate Genes A QTL is a region of the genome shown to be linked to a trait. The purpose of mapping this region is to identify a region of a genome that has a higher probability of harbouring the genetic variations controlling variability in trait values.",
      "Often a local eQTL will be caused by allelic variation in the regulatory region of the gene or within the gene itself. mQTL A metabolite Quantitative Trait Locus is a region in the genome at which allelic variation correlates with the abundance variation of a certain metabolite. pQTL A protein Quantitative Trait Locus is a region in the genome at which allelic variation correlates with the abundance variation of a certain protein. Just like eQTL, pQTL can be local or distant according to the genomic position of the gene encoding for the protein relative to the QTL.",
      "QTLs are regions within the genome whose genetic variation modulates quantitatively a phenotype characteristic of the particular trait under study (Lynch and Walsh, 1998). Determining the association between variations in specific disease phenotypes or a trait, with variations in genotypes of a reference population can be used to locate a QTL. One of the methods used for mapping QTLs associated with complex traits is genetic markers-trait association. Genetic markers associated with certain loci can be inherited in linkage disequilibrium. Generating populations with linked loci in disequilibrium is achieved though either crosses between inbred lines, or use of the out-bred populations.",
      "Quantitative trait locus-mapping is a statistical method used to map chromosomal intervals (loci) that contribute to heritable variance in phenotypes. The method simply compares the inheritance of allelic variants (B or D genotypes in our case) with differences in phenotypes. A QTL will generally cover a region that includes 10\u2013100 genes, and these positional candidates can then be ranked roughly on the basis of criteria such as the types of DNA variants, patterns of mRNA expression, data from complementary human genetic cohorts (GWAS and linkage) and relevant literature about gene effects on central nervous system structure and function.",
      "Chromosomal regions containing a gene (or genes) that a\u00a1ect the level of a quantitative trait are called quantitative trait loci (QTLs). The relevant genes in these regions have been called quantitative trait genes (QTGs) (Hitzemann et al 2003). Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis is an experimental strategy for identifying QTLs, and ultimately QTGs, that a\u00a1ect quantitative traits. Because of the complexity of these traits, progress in identifying QTGs has been slow compared to that in cloning genes underlying Mendelian traits (Glazier et al 2002).",
      "Expression QTL Next, we will examine expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). These are QTLs for gene expression traits, a subset of the molecular phenotypes mentioned above. Much like classical phenotypes, expression of transcripts can be influenced by variants within the genome. However, because we know the location of the gene, we can split these eQTL into two categories, trans- (or distal) or cis- (or local) eQTL. A trans-eQTL (or distal-eQTL) describes when the expression of a gene is influenced by a locus far away from that gene, and therefore indicates that the gene of interest is downstream of another gene.",
      "These loci which are associated with changes in transcript expression are often termed expression QTL (eQTL): a variant (or variants) within the locus alters the expression of the gene of interest. An eQTL found near to the location (~ \u2264 1Mbp) of the transcript is described as a local eQTL, and are often called ciseQTL. This is in contrast to trans-eQTL which are found more distally. Cis-eQTL are interesting when they are found for a gene within a QTL for another phenotype (e.g.",
      "The location of these genotypes are quantitative trait loci (QTLs) [Abiola et al. , 2003]. Detected via statistical methods [Doerge, 2002], QTLs are stretches of DNA highly associated with a specific phenotype, analogous to genetic landmarks which roughly indicate the position of the active gene. QTLs are not defined at very fine granularity; they usually correspond to areas large enough to hold several genes. The genetic polymorphism (genotypes) in neighboring areas of a set of loci, as a group, influence structure and function on both molecular and organismic scales.",

      "These are referred to as expression QTLs, or eQTLs (Schadt et al. , 2003), which control a portion of expression variation of particular genes in a population. eQTLs result from genetic differences in regulatory elements close to or within the gene (apparent cis-acting eQTLs) as well as those that map elsewhere in the genome from the gene whose expression is modulated (trans-acting eQTLs). By combining microarray and QTL analysis on the same mice, much can be learned about the genetic underpinnings of particular alcohol traits (Hitzemann et al. , 2004; Tabakoff et al. , 2003).",
      "Working with complex traits that typically vary in their manifestation across a continuous distribution, in contrast to the binary nature of monogenic traits, QTLs are discovered by simply identifying loci with alleles that consistently covary with a phenotype across a population. Genomic regions that show a sufficiently strong association with a phenotype are considered QTLs. The simplest, or most hopeful, interpretation of a mapped QTL is that the implicated region harbors a single gene affecting manifestation of the associated phenotype.",
      "By definition, a quantitative trait locus is a chromosomal region that contains a gene, or genes, that regulate a portion of the genetic variation for a particular phenotype (Wehner et al. 2001). The goal of QTL mapping is to identify regions of the genome that harbour genes relevant to a specified trait. QTL map locations are commonly determined by initial screening of mice with specific genetic characteristics, such as recombinant inbred strains, the F2 of two inbred strains, or recombinant congenic strains (Flint 2003).",
      "(2003) and others defined the expression QTLs (eQTLs) as either cis (mapping near the gene locus) or trans (mapping elsewhere in the genome). When behavioral QTLs (bQTLs) and cis-eQTLs overlap, the cis-eQTL genes are inferred as strong quantitative trait gene (QTG) candidates (see e.g. Farris et al. 2010). The situation for trans-eQTLs is more complicated since the QTL confidence interval is generally larger and any gene within the QTL interval could have a regulatory role. The application of genetical genomics to mouse has generally focused on segregating populations involving R. Hitzemann et al.",
      "Page 2  Definition of a QTL NIH-PA Author Manuscript  A quantitative trait is one that has measurable phenotypic variation owing to genetic and/or environmental influences. This variation can consist of discrete values, such as the number of separate tumours in the intestine of a cancer-prone mouse, or can be continuous, such as measurements of height, weight and blood pressure. Sometimes a threshold must be crossed for the quantitative trait to be expressed; this is common among complex diseases. A QTL is a genetic locus, the alleles of which affect this variation.",
      "When the phenotype of interest is a quantitative trait, such as blood pressure or cholesterol levels, the underlying genetic locus is referred to as a \u201cQTL\u201d. A common strategy investigates the association between quantitative traits of transcriptional responses and their underlying DNA loci called \u201cresponse QTLs\u201d (reQTLs) (Albert and Kruglyak 2015). Studies have provided clear evidence for the colocalization of reQTLs and disease-related loci (Caliskan et al. 2015).",
      "81 Gene Expression Quantitative Trait Locus Analysis Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping is a statistical technique that finds associations between phenotype and genotype in a genetically segregating population (Lander and Botstein 1989). Here, we performed eQTL mapping on the male and female data separately. There were 1,137 significant (q\u22640.5 and p\u22640.025) male and 1,232  female eQTLs. First, we explored differences in patterns of eQTL locations between sexes by plotting the genomic locations of each eQTL versus the transcript location (Figure 4.3a, b).",

      "  Current data processing capabilities have also made it possible to search genome-wide for QTL (quantitative trait loci) [109].QTL mapping seeks to identify the relationship between various genomic locations and a set of quantitative traits, leading to a chromosomal location and ultimately to identification of gene(s) with the final goal of looking at gene expression.Among other things, this will lead to a better understanding of genetic mechanisms of variation and adaptation [121].Results can then be applied to adjust conservation measures in response to rapid change, for example, by identifying the genetic adaptability potential of individuals to be used in assisted migration or reintroduction [122,123]."
