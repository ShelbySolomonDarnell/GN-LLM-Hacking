    "Gene-environment interactions influence diabetes risk and progression by the interplay of genetic predisposition and environmental factors such as diet, physical activity, and lifestyle. Certain genetic variants may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D), but this risk can be modified by environmental factors. For instance, the adverse effect of some T2D-associated genetic variants may be attenuated by higher physical activity levels or a healthy lifestyle. Conversely, low physical activity and dietary factors characterizing a Western dietary pattern may augment the risk. Understanding these interactions can help in the development of personalized prevention strategies and treatments for T2D.",
    "MicroRNAs and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in diabetes. MicroRNAs modulate post-transcriptional control of gene expression through degradation or translational repression of key messenger RNAs. They can regulate pathogenic responses such as angiogenesis, blood flow, neural cell dysfunction, tissue-specific inflammation and glucose metabolism. They also hold potential as diagnostic biomarkers and possible drug-targets for regulation of dysfunctional cell responses. LncRNAs are implicated in complications associated with diabetes, such as diabetic retinopathy and diabetic nephropathy. They can regulate cell proliferation, viability, migration, and the expression of pathological genes via post-transcriptional mechanisms.",

    "Yes, genetic predictors of diabetes complications can be identified. Studies have revealed several susceptibility loci for diabetic complications such as retinopathy and nephropathy. However, these genetic factors only explain a small proportion of the phenotypic variation observed in type 2 diabetes patients, indicating a need for the identification of more novel genetic risk factors.",
    "The varying efficacy of diabetes treatments among individuals can be attributed to genetic variants present in drug receptors or drug metabolizers, such as OCT genes, KCNJ11, ABCC8, and CYP2C9. These genetic variants can influence the metabolism, transportation, and therapeutic mechanisms of antidiabetic drugs, leading to differences in drug disposition, glycemic response, tolerability, and incidence of adverse effects. Additionally, gene-gene, gene-environment, and gene-treatment interactions may also contribute to the variation in disease progression and response to therapy."

      "Additional evidence supporting a potentially important role for environmental modulation of genetic risk was found in previous population studies.For example, although some of the GWASidentified T2D loci could be replicated successfully in various populations (e.g., CDKAL1, HHEX, IGF2BP2, TCF7L2 and SLC30A8), more genetic variants have been identified only in some specific populations [26].T2D risk alleles showed extreme directional differentiation between different populations compared with other common diseases [29].Different T2D loci and loci frequencies across different populations may reflect the adaptation to the local environments and diets along with human migration [30].Therefore, the interplay between gene and environment leads to a more complex pathogenesis of T2D and related traits.These hypotheses are strongly supported by a number of recent GxE studies [7,11,31,32].For example, Qi et al. [31] generated a genetic risk score (GRS) using ten GWAS-identified SNPs and observed a significant interaction between the Western dietary pattern and GRS in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study.The Western dietary pattern was only positively associated with risk of T2D among men with a high GRS, but not with low GRS subjects.Another large meta-analysis of 14 cohort studies [32] revealed that dietary whole-grain intake potentially interacted with one GCKR variant (rs780094) for fasting insulin in individuals of European descent.Greater whole-grain intake was associated with a smaller reduction of fasting insulin in individuals with the insulin-raising allele of rs780094, compared to the non-risk allele.",
      "Gene\u2013exercise interaction in type 2 diabetes When studying gene\u2013environment interaction on the quantitative traits that underlie diabetes, the power to detect interaction is highly dependent on the precision with which non-genetic exposures are measured (Wareham et al 2002). Achievement of optimal glycaemic control is the focus of traditional treatment paradigms. Regular exercise, both aerobic (walking, jogging, or cycling) and resistance (weightlifting) training results in increased glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity and is a primary modality used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes patients (Sigal et al 2007).",
      "Gene-Environment Interaction  Evidence from the epidemiology of T2D overwhelmingly supports a strong environmental influence interacting with genetic predisposition in a synergistic fashion as has been recently reviewed [123], however current state-of-the-art methods for measuring environmental effects lack precision and can result in changes in statistical power to detect interaction [123,124].Since lifestyle factors are important in preventing diabetes [125,126], interaction of gene variants with measures of dietary intake and exercise have been selected for studies on gene-environment interaction.For example, HNF1B (rs 4430796) was shown to interact with exercise; low levels of activity enhanced the risk of T2D in association with absence of the risk allele, but there was no protective effect of exercise when the allele was present.It follows that subgrouping by genotype may serve to enhance risk prediction while considering gene-environment interaction as has been done for exercise [127].Also lifestyle including exercise modified the effect of a CDKN2A/B variant on 2-hour glucose levels in the Diabetes Prevention Program [128] but was not confirmed in the HERITAGE study using different measurements and phenotypes involving insulin sensitivity and \u03b2-cell function [129].The pro12ala PPARG variant also interacts with physical activity for effect on 2-hour glucose levels [130], which was confirmed in the smaller HERITAGE study [129].In addition, a relationship of dietary fat intake with plasma insulin and BMI differs by the pro12ala PPARG genotype [131].",
      "A person's risk of type 2 diabetes or obesity reflects the joint effects of genetic predisposition and relevant environmental exposures.Efforts to determine whether these genetic and environmental components of risk interact (in the statistical sense that joint effects cannot be predicted from main effects alone) 70 face challenges associated with measuring relevant exposures (diet and physical activity being notoriously difficult to estimate) and the effect of imprecision on statistical power. 71Although claims that statistical interactions reflect shared mechanisms (i.e., that the interacting factors act through the same pathways) are probably overstated, understanding the relative contributions of genetic and environmental components to risk is important.After all, environmental factors can be modified more readily than genetic factors.Genetic discoveries have provided a molecular basis for the clinically useful classification of monogenic forms of diabetes and obesity. 3,4Will the same be true for the common forms of these conditions?Probably not: as far as the common variants are concerned, each patient with diabetes or obesity has an individual \"barcode\" of susceptibility alleles and protective alleles across many loci.It is possible to show that the genetic profiles of lean subjects with type 2 diabetes and obese subjects with type 2 diabetes are not identical, but these differences appear to be inadequate for clinically useful subclassification. 22,72f efforts to uncover less prevalent, higher-penetrance alleles are successful, more precise classification of disease subtypes may become possible, particularly if genetic data can be integrated with clinical and biochemical information.For example, in persons presenting with diabetes in early adulthood, there are several possible diagnoses: various subtypes of maturity-onset diabetes of the young or mitochondrial diabetes, for example, as well as type 1 or type 2 diabetes.Assigning the correct diagnosis has both prognostic and therapeutic benefits for the patient (Table 3).",
      "Genes, environment, and development of type 2 diabetes  Genes and the environment together are important determinants of insulin resistance and \u03b2-cell dysfunction (fi gure 2).Because changes in the gene pool cannot account for the rapid increase in prevalence of type 2 diabetes in recent decades, environmental changes are essential to understanding of the epidemic.",
      "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is thought to arise from the complex interplay of both genetic and environmental factors.Since the advent of genomewide association studies (GWAS), we have seen considerable progress in our understanding of the role that genetics and gene-environment interactions play in the development of T2D.Recent work suggests that the adverse effect of several T2D loci may be abolished or at least attenuated by higher physical activity levels or healthy lifestyle, whereas low physical activity and dietary factors characterizing a Western dietary pattern may augment it.However, there still remain inconsistencies warranting further investigation.Lack of statistical power and measurement errors for the environmental factors continue to challenge our efforts for characterizing interactions.Although our recent focus on established T2D loci is reasonable, we may be overlooking many other potential loci not captured by recent T2D GWAS.Agnostic approaches to the discovery of gene and environment interactions may address this possibility, but their application to the field is currently limited and still faces conceptual challenges.Nonetheless, continued investment in gene-environment interaction studies through large collaborative efforts holds promise in furthering our understanding of the interplay between genetic and environmental factors.",

      "Gene and Environment Selection  Environmental factors selected for recent G \u00d7 E interactions studies continue to be the established modifiable risk factors for T2D such as obesity, physical activity, dietary fat, and carbohydrate quality as well as measures of pre-and post-uterine environment.The genetic factors selected, however, have shifted from biological candidates based on functional evidence to genome-wide established loci for T2D or related traits (Table 1).This approach may improve power to detect and strengthen causal inference for an interaction (49).Focusing on established T2D loci may also further our understanding of their functional role in disease development in addition to their public health relevance in the context of genetic risk modification (13).",
      "We have seen considerable progress in our understanding of the role that both environment and genetics play in the development of T2D.Recent work suggests that the adverse effect of some established T2D-associated loci may be greatly attenuated by appropriate changes in certain lifestyle factors.Our recent approach to studies of G \u00d7 E interactions in T2D has gained considerable advantage over previous approaches, but it is clearly not optimal.Lack of statistical power and measurement error for environmental factors will continue to challenge our efforts to characterize G \u00d7 E interactions.Although our recent focus on established T2D loci is reasonable, we may be overlooking many other potential loci not captured by recent T2D GWAS.Agnostic approaches to the discovery of G \u00d7 E interactions may address this possibility, but their application to the field is currently limited and still faces conceptual challenges.Nevertheless, large collaborative efforts have the potential to uncover true G \u00d7 E interactions, which will enhance our understanding of the interplays between genes and environment in the etiology of T2D.",
      "The purpose of the present review is to summarize recent epidemiological approaches and progress pertaining to gene-environment (G \u00d7 E) interactions potentially implicated in the pathogenesis of T2D and its related traits.We also discuss continuing challenges, evolving approaches, and recommendations for future efforts in this field.",
      "FUTURE PERSPECTIVES  Continued investment in studies of G \u00d7 E interactions for T2D holds promise on several grounds.First, such studies may provide insight into the function of novel T2D loci and pathways by which environmental exposures act and, therefore, yield a better understanding of T2D etiology (66).They could also channel experimental studies in a productive direction.Second, knowledge of G \u00d7 E interactions may help identify high-risk individuals for diet and lifestyle interventions.This may also apply to pharmacological interventions if individuals carrying certain genotypes are more or less responsive to specific medications.The finding that patients with rare forms of neonatal diabetes resulting from KCNJ11 mutations respond better to sulfonylurea than to insulin therapy is just one example demonstrating the potential for this application of G \u00d7 E interaction research (69).Third, we are fast approaching an era when individuals can feasibly obtain their complete genetic profile and thus a snapshot of their genetic predisposition to disease.It will therefore be the responsibility of health professionals to ensure that their patients have an accurate interpretation of this information and a means to curb their genetic risk.A long-held goal of genetic research has been to tailor diet and lifestyle advice to an individual's genetic profile, which will, in turn, motivate him or her to adopt and maintain a protective lifestyle.There is currently no evidence that this occurs.Findings to date, however, indicate that behavioral changes can substantially mitigate diabetogenic and obesogenic effects of individual or multiple risk alleles, which has much broader clinical and public health implications.",
      "Gene-Nutrient or Dietary Pattern Interactions in The Development of T2DM  Recently, several studies have demonstrated the significant effects of genotype by environment interactions on T2DM [48,49].However, further clarification of the role of these interactions at the genome-wide level could help predict disease risk more accurately and facilitate the development of dietary recommendations to improve prevention and treatment.Moreover, it would be very interesting to identify the specific dietary factors that are the most influential in the variation of a given T2DM-related phenotype and to what extent these dietary factors contribute to the phenotypic variation (Table 2).In particular, the dietary factors considered are macro-and micronutrients, foods and type of diets.A recent review present evidence on the dietary environment and genetics as risk factors for T2DM [50]. * Adiponectin (ADIPOQ).",
      "Introduction  Genome wide association studies (GWAS) of type 2 diabetes mellitus and relevant endophenotypes have shed new light on the complex etiology of the disease and underscored the multiple molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenic processes leading to hyperglycemia [1].Even though these studies have successfully mapped many diabetes risk genetic loci that could not be detected by linkage analysis, the risk single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) have small effect sizes and generally explain little of disease heritability estimates [2].The poor contribution of risk loci to diabetes inheritance suggests a prominent role of environmental factors (eg.diet, physical activity, lifestyle), gene \u00c2 environment interactions and epigenetic mechanisms in the pathological processes leading to the deterioration of glycemic control [3,4].",
      "The literature on gene-environment interactions in diabetes-related traits is extensive, but few studies are accompanied by adequate replication data or compelling mechanistic explanations.Moreover, most studies are cross-sectional, from which temporal patterns and causal effects cannot be confidently ascertained.This has undermined confidence in many published reports of gene-environment interactions across many diseases; although interaction studies in psychiatry have been especially heavily criticized [3], many of the points made in that area relate to other diseases, not least to T2D, where the diagnostic phenotype (elevated blood glucose or HbA1c) is a consequence of underlying and usually unmeasured physiological defects (e.g., at the level of the pancreatic beta-cell, peripheral tissue, liver, and gut), and the major environmental risk factors are difficult to measure well.Nevertheless, several promising examples of geneenvironment interactions relating to cardiometabolic disease exist, as discussed below and described in Table 1, and interaction studies with deep genomic coverage in large cohorts are now conceivable; the hope is that these studies will highlight novel disease mechanisms and biological pathways that will fuel subsequent functional and clinical translation studies.This is important, because diabetes medicine may rely increasingly on genomic stratification of patient populations and disease phenotype, for which gene-environment interaction studies might prove highly informative.",
      "The genome is often the conduit through which environmental exposures convey their effects on health and disease.Whilst not all diseases act by directly perturbing the genome, the phenotypic responses are often genetically determined.Hence, whilst diseases are often defined has having differing degrees of genetic determination, genetic and environmental factors are, with few exceptions, inseparable features of most diseases, not least type 2 diabetes.It follows that to optimize diabetes, prevention and treatment will require that the etiological roles of genetic and environmental risk factors be jointly considered.As we discuss here, studies focused on quantifying gene-environment and gene-treatment interactions are gathering momentum and may eventually yield data that helps guide health-related choices and medical interventions for type 2 diabetes and other complex diseases.",

      "Predisposition is influenced by the level of certain environmental exposures, personal factors, access to good-quality primary care, and by genotype.Interactions between genetic and nongenetic risk factors are hypothesized to raise diabetes risk in a synergistic manner; reciprocally, health-enhancing changes in behavior, body composition, or medication may reduce the risk of disease conveyed by genetic factors.Defining the nature of these interactions and identifying ways through which reliable observations of gene-environment interactions (GEIs) can be translated into the public health setting might help 1) optimize targeting of health interventions to persons most likely to respond well to them, 2) improve cost-and health-effectiveness of existing preventive and treatment paradigms; 3) reduce unnecessary adverse consequences of interventions; 4) increase patient adherence to health practitioners' recommendations; and 5) identify novel interventions that are beneficial only in a defined genetic subgroup of the population.In this Perspective, we describe the rationale and evidence relating to the existence of gene-environment and genetreatment interactions in type 2 diabetes.We discuss the tried, tested, and oftenfailed approaches to investigating genelifestyle interactions in type 2 diabetes; we discuss some recent developments in gene-treatment interactions (pharmacogenetics); and we look forward to the strategies that are likely to dominate these fields of research in the future.We conclude with a discussion of the requirements for translating findings from these future studies into a form where they can be used to help predict, prevent, or treat diabetes.Here we describe the rationale and evidence concerning GEIs and gene-treatment interactions in type 2 diabetes, provide an interpretation of current findings and strategies, and offer a view for their future translation.",
      "T2DM results from the contribution of many genes [10] , many environmental factors [11] , and the interactions among those genetic and environmental factors.Physical activity and dietary fat have been reported to be important modifiers of the associations between glucose homeostasis and well-known candidate genes for T2DM [12] and there is reason to believe that a significant proportion of the susceptibility genes identified by GWASs will interact with these environmental factors to influence the disease risk.Florez et al. [13] reported that response to the Diabetes Prevention Program lifestyle intervention did not differ by genotype groups at TCF7L2 rs7903146 [13] .A more recent report from the Diabetes Prevention Program [14] showed that among 10 of the recently identified diabetes susceptibility polymorphisms (single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs), only CDKN2A/B rs10811661 was shown to marginally modify the effect of the lifestyle intervention on diabetes risk reduction.Similarly, the study of Brito et al. [15] reported that among 17 of the diabetes SNPs, only HNF1B rs4430796 significantly interacted with physical activity to influence impaired glucose tolerance risk and incident diabetes.",
      "Gene-Environment  Interactions.An risk of developing T2D is the product of interaction between the individual's genetic constitution and the environment inhabited by the individual.Whilst the contribution of genetic factors to disease risk is relatively easy to quantify, the impact of environmental exposure is less easily measured in a clinical setting.Nevertheless, efforts have been made to study the interactions between some of the known susceptibility loci for T2D and the environment, and these findings may be useful for the development of prediction models and tailoring clinical treatment for T2D [122,123].For example, for carriers of the risk allele for TCF7L2, diets of low glycaemic load [124,125] and a more intensive lifestyle modification regime (versus that recommended for nonrisk carriers) [61,62,126,127] have been shown to reduce the risk of T2D.Meaningful studies for gene-environment interactions will require samples of sufficient size to increase statistical power [128] and accurate methods for measuring environmental exposure, for example, the use of metabolomics to identify and assess metabolic characteristics, changes, and phenotypes in response to the environment, diet, lifestyle, and pathophysiological states.This information will allow the generation of better risk prediction models and personalisation/stratification of treatment, the holy grail of GWAS.",
      "Other aspects that have been overlooked in large GWAS on T2DM relate to environmental effects such as diet, physical activity, and stresses, which may affect gene expression.For example, fish oil may stimulate PPARG in much the same fashion as the thiazolidinedione class of drugs; however, studies on the interaction of the PPARG variant with dietary components have not been performed.The spectacular rise in the incidence of diabetes among Pima Indians and other populations as they adopt Western diets and lifestyles dramatically demonstrates the key role of the environment [12].Consequently, it could be expected that the effect of a common gene variant among populations that have very different diets and exercise habits might be totally different, thus explaining some instances of lack of replication. [4].Another variable that influences the statistical and real association of an SNP with a disease or response to a diet is epigenetic interaction.Epigenesis is the study of heritable changes in gene function that occur without a change in the DNA sequence, such as DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling.Both mechanisms can affect gene expression by altering the accessibility of DNA to regulatory proteins or complexes such as transcription factors, and they can be influenced by certain nutrients and by overall caloric intake.Thus, it can be expected that long-term exposure to certain diets could produce permanent epigenetic changes in the genome [7]."

      "Platelets are key partaker in CVD and their involvement in the development of cardiovascular complications is strengthened in diabetes (148).Platelets play an important role in the pathophysiology of thrombosis and represent an important source of different RNA species, including pseudogenes, intronic transcripts, non-coding RNAs, and antisense transcripts (149,150).These molecules can be released by platelets through microvescicles, contributing to the horizontal transfer of molecular signals delivered through the bloodstream to specific sites of action (151).The downregulation of miR-223, miR-126, or 146a observed in diabetic and hyperglycemic patients (137,152) has been associated with increased platelet reactivity and aggregation (153,154).In line with these findings, silencing of miR-223 in mice caused a hyperreactive and hyperadhesive platelet phenotype, and was associated with calpain activation through the increased expression of beta1 integrin, kindlin-3, and factor XIII (153,155).Moreover, the modulation of the expression levels of platelet miRNAs can also be measured in plasma.In fact, plasma levels of miR-223 and miR-126 are decreased in diabetics (137,156).This leads to the upregulation of the P2Y12 receptor, as well as P-selectin, further contributing to platelet dysfunction (156).As a result of this interaction, activation level of platelets in type 2 DM is increased (149,156,157).Consistently with this, circulating miR-223 levels are independent predictors of high on-treatment platelet reactivity (158).Another interesting mechanism linking platelets and diabetes involves miR-103b, a platelet-derived biomarker proposed for the early diagnosis of type 2 DM, and the secreted frizzledrelated protein-4 (SFRP4), a potential biomarker of early \u03b2 cell dysfunction and diabetes.In fact, platelet-derived miR-103b is able to downregulate SFRP4, whose expression levels are significantly increased in pancreatic islets and in the blood of patients with prediabetes or overt diabetes (159).These interesting results identify miR-103b as a novel potential marker of prediabetes and diabetes, and disclose a novel potential therapeutic target in type 2 DM.",
      "In vitro and in vivo studies concerning the mechanisms that are responsible for the endothelial dysfunction in diabetes demonstrated that, in the presence of high glucose concentrations, upregulation of miR-185 reduced the expression of the glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPx-1) gene, which encodes an enzyme that is important in the prevention of oxidative stress (129); instead upregulation of miR-34a and miR-204 contributed to endothelial cell senescence by impairing SIRT-1 expression and function (130,131).In the endothelium, miR-126 exerts proangiogenic, and anti-inflammatory activities.At a functional level, it enhances VEGF and fibroblast growth factor activities, contributing to vascular integrity and angiogenesis (132,133), recruits progenitor cells through the chemokine CXCL12 (134), while it suppresses inflammation by inhibiting TNF-\u03b1, ROS, and NADPH oxidase via HMGB1 (135).Consistently, miR-126 levels are down-regulated in both myocardial tissue and plasma from type 2 diabetic patients without any known anamnestic data for CVD (136,137), and in patients with CAD (138), suggesting that it could represent a new diagnostic marker for diabetes and CVD.Other studies in endothelial colony-forming cells, as well as in progenitor endothelial cells (EPCs) exposed to high glucose, demonstrated that miR-134 and miR-130a affected cell motility and apoptosis, respectively (139,140).",
      "Numerous recent reports have demonstrated abnormal expression of various miRNAs in renal, vascular and retinal cells under diabetic conditions, and in vivo models of related diabetic complications [8,[87][88][89][90][91]. Notably, the functional relevance of these miRNAs has been highlighted by the fact they target key genes associated with the progression of, or protection against, these complications.In particular, the role of miRNAs in diabetic nephropathy has been extensively studied, including in the actions of TGF-\u03b2 related to fibrosis and other key renal outcomes in vitro and in vivo [8,[87][88][89][90].In diabetic retinopathy, several miRNAs have been reported to modulate the disease by targeting factors associated with angiogenesis, inflammation, and oxidant stress in RECs and in diabetic retinas [88,89].Reports have also implicated various miRNAs in the aberrant expression of genes associated with diabetic cardiomyopathy [88,91].In addition, effective in vivo targeting of miRNAs has now been demonstrated thanks to advances in nucleotide chemistry and the design of nuclease-resistant anti-miRNAs, which suggest future translational potential of miRNA-based therapies for human diabetic complications [8].Importantly, since miRNAs are stable in biological fluids such as urine and serum [8], they are being assessed in samples from various clinical cohorts as valuable biomarkers for the early detection of diabetic complications, for which there is a major unmet clinical need.It is clear that research in the field of miRNAs and diabetic complications will continue at a rapid pace.",
      "Introduction  Diabetes-related complications represent one of the most important health problems worldwide with dire social and economic projections (Cooper, 2012).One of the most important medical concerns of the diabetes epidemic is diabetic nephropathy (DN).Diabetic nephropathy is regarded as a prototypical disease of gene and environmental interactions because not all diabetic subjects with traditional risk factors develop clinically evident nephropathy, indicating a role for individual susceptibility.The majority (>85%) of GWAS-identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are located in the non-coding regions of the genome and thus their functional implication lies in identifying the target genes, cell types, and the mode of dysregulation caused by these non-coding SNPs (Maurano et al., 2012).Recent studies indicate that complex trait-causing variants localize to cell-type-specific, functionally important gene regulatory regions where they can disrupt or create transcription factor binding sites to alter transcript levels only in disease-target cell types (Ko and Susztak, 2013;Susztak, 2014).Several elements of the immune system including cytokines and resident chemokines, macrophage recruitment, T lymphocytes, and immune complex deposition have recently been associated with DN (Navarro-Gonz\u00e1lez and Mora-Fern\u00e1ndez, 2008;Gaballa and Farag, 2013).Since renal cells are also capable of synthesizing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrotic factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), therefore, these cytokines acting in a paracrine or autocrine manner may induce significant effects leading to the development and progression of several renal disorders (Matoba et al., 2010;Pruijm et al., 2012;Shankar et al., 2011).The rationale of this study involved a concerted effort of genotyping, correlation and gene expression techniques involving three pro-inflammatory cytokine genes  in the development and progression of DN as well as identification of high risk patients involving susceptibility or poor clinical outcome.",

      "One of the major problems facing clinical nephrology currently throughout the world is an exponential increase in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), which is largely related to a high incidence of diabetic nephropathy.The latter is characterized by a multitude of metabolic and signaling events following excessive channeling of glucose, which leads to an increased synthesis of extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoproteins resulting in glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis and ultimately ESRD.With the incidence of nephropathy at pandemic levels and a high rate of ESRD, physicians around the world must treat a disproportionately large number of diabetic patients with upto-date innovative measures.In this regard, identification of genes that are crucially involved in the progression of diabetic nephropathy would enhance the discovery of new biomarkers and could also promote the development of novel therapeutic strategies.Over the last decade, we focused on the recent methodologies of high-throughput and genome-wide screening for identification of relevant genes in various animal models, which included the following: (1) single nucleotide polymorphism-based genome-wide screening; (2) the transcriptome approach, such as differential display reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (DDRT-PCR), representational difference analysis of cDNA (cDNA-RDA)/suppressive subtractive hybridization, SAGE (serial analysis of gene expression) and DNA Microarray; and (3) the proteomic approach and 2-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) coupled with mass spectroscopic analysis.Several genes, such as Tim44 (translocase of inner mito-chondrial membrane-44), RSOR/MIOX (renal specific oxidoreductase/myo-inositol oxygenase), UbA52, Rap1b (Ras-related GTPase), gremlin, osteopontin, hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-3\u03b2 isotype 4 and those of the Wnt signaling pathway, were identified as differentially expressed genes in kidneys of diabetic rodents.Functional analysis of these genes and the subsequent translational research in the clinical settings would be very valuable in the prevention and treatment of diabetic nephropathy.Future trends for identification of the biomarkers and therapeutic target genes should also include genome scale DNA/histonemethylation profiling, metabolomic approaches (e.g.metabolic phenotyping by 1H spectroscopy) and lectin microarray for glycan profiling along with the development of robust data-mining strategies.",
      "M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D  In relation to the regulation of gene expression, the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in diabetic retinopathy has been gaining more emphasis.miRNAs are non-coding small RNAs which modulate post-transcriptional control of gene expression through degradation or translational repression of key messenger RNAs.miRNAs can be detected in serum (free, associated with proteins or within membrane-bound particles) (Weiland et al., 2012), vitreous (Ragusa et al., 2013) and aqueous (Dunmire et al., 2013).As reviewed by Mastropasqua et al., miRNAs hold considerable interest for diabetic retinopathy since they can regulate important pathogenic responses such as angiogenesis, blood flow, neural cell dysfunction, tissue-specific inflammation and glucose metabolism (Mastropasqua et al., 2014).Although based on a small patient sample, it has been reported that three separate miRNAs (miR-21, miR-181c, and miR-1179) in serum of patients with diabetic retinopathy have potential to be used as biomarkers for early detection of disease (Li et al., 2014;Qing et al., 2014).While this is still a growing research area, miRNAs hold considerable clinical potential in the diabetic retinopathy field, both as possible drug-targets for regulation of dysfunctional cell responses and as diagnostic biomarkers.",
      "Roles of lncRNAs in diabetic complications  Apart from being involved in major metabolic tissues during diabetes as discussed above, lncRNAs are implicated in complications associated with diabetes.Diabetic retinopathy is one of the common complications in diabetic patients, which leads to impaired or loss of vision.Altered expression of lncRNAs, namely MALAT1 [82,83] and MEG3 [84], are reported to be associated with diabetic retinopathy.In STZ-induced diabetic rats, the expression of MALAT1 is elevated in the endothelial cells of the retina and knockdown of MALAT1 ameliorates retinopathy in STZ-induced rats [82].The lncRNA, MEG3, was also found to be downregulated in the retina of STZ-induced diabetic mice and its in vitro knockdown in retinal endothelial cells was found to regulate cell proliferation, viability, and migration [84].Hyperglycemia as in diabetes causes upregulation of ANRIL levels in endothelial cells [85,86], and this elevates the levels of the PRC2 subunit, EZH2 that consequently promotes the expression of VEGF, a key promoter of angiogenesis [85].Another major complication associated with diabetes is diabetic nephropathy, and this is considered a major cause of end-stage renal disease and disability in diabetic patients [87].Recent studies show that lncRNAs play important roles in the development of diabetic nephropathy and accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins.There is higher expression of the lncRNA, PVT1, during diabetic nephropathy, and this increase leads to increased fibrosis due to accumulation of ECM proteins in renal cells [88]; downregulation of PVT1 reduces ECM accumulation [88].LncRNA PVT1 is also a host to miR-1207-5p and this miRNA is shown to regulate the expression of fibronectin1 (FN1), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI1), and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF\u03b21) [89].In renal tube injury during diabetes, the lncRNA, MIAT, is under-expressed, and this negatively correlates with creatinine and BUN levels in the serum of these subjects.It has been shown to regulate cell viability of proximal convoluted renal tubules [90].In diabetic nephropathic mice, the lncRNA, MGC, is increased in renal mesangial cells.Interestingly, this lncRNA harbours a cluster of approximately 40 miRNAs, and is regulated by the ER stress marker C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) [91].In CHOP -deficient mice, there is decreased expression of the lncRNA, MGC, and the clustered miRNAs, and these mice have shown an improvement in diabetic nephropathy [91].Diabetic nephropathy is also associated with increased levels of lincRNA, Gm4419, and this exerts its action by interacting with NF-\u03ba\u03b2.Knockdown of this lincRNA in renal mesangial cells lowers cellular proliferation and inhibits expression of NF-\u03ba\u03b2 in hyperglycemic states [92].The lncRNA, TUG1, that is upregulated in diabetic nephropathy acts as sponge for miR-377 and regulates PPAR-\u03b3 expression which further modulates the expression of FN1, collagen type IV alpha 1 chain (COL4A1), PAI1, and TGF\u03b21 in renal mesangial cells [93].Diabetic cardiomyopathy is a critical end-stage complication associated with diabetes.Several such cardiovascular complications and myocardial dysfunction in diabetic patients lead to heart failure [94].Differential expression analysis in cardiac tissue from normal and diabetic rats shows that the lncRNA, MALAT1, is upregulated during cardiomyopathy and knockdown of this lncRNA improves left ventricular systolic function by reducing myocardial inflammation in diabetic rats [95,96].Decreased expression of the lncRNA, H19, is also reported during diabetes [68,70], and this often results in decreased expression of the exonic miRNA, miR-675 [97,98].mir-675 directly targets the voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) which is involved in mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in the cardiac tissue during diabetes.H19 overexpression in diabetic rats reduces oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation, and improves ventricle function [98].LncRNAs NONRATT021972 and uc.48+ are reported to be associated with diabetic neuropathic pain [99,100], and inhibition of both have been shown to alleviate such neuropathic pain by activating the P2X3 receptor.Impaired wound closure is a notable complication associated with diabetes and a recent report shows decreased levels of the lncRNA, Lethe in such impaired dorsal wounds of diabetic mice.This was demonstrated to be associated with increased ROS production, possibly through regulation of NOX2 expression [101].",

      "An overall important consideration in study design is that similar to RNA, noncoding RNAs are tissue and cell specific [24,[77][78][79][80][81][82].Given that it is still unknown if pathogenic changes in AMD are localized to specific ocular tissues or systemic, one must take into consideration that potential biomarkers identified in the peripheral blood as \"disease associated\" may not reflect the disease mechanism occurring in the neural retina and/or RPE.",
      "Skol et al. developed methods to study genomics and transcriptomics together to help discover genes that cause diabetic retinopathy.Genes involved in how cells respond to high blood sugar were first identified using cells grown in the lab.By comparing the activity of these genes in people with and without retinopathy the study identified genes associated with an increased risk of retinopathy in diabetes.In people with retinopathy, the activity of the folliculin gene (FLCN) increased more in response to high blood sugar.This was further verified with independent groups of people and using computer models to estimate the effect of different versions of the folliculin gene.",
      "miRNAs in Kidney Disease and Diabetic Nephropathy  Diabetic nephropathy is a progressive kidney disease and a major debilitating complication of both type 1 and type 2  diabetes that can lead to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and related cardiovascular disorders.Absence or lower levels of particular miRNAs in the kidney compared with other organs may permit renal specific expression of target proteins that are important for kidney functions [45].Figure 4 depicts the connection between the role of miRNAs and kidney fibrosis.Altered expression of miRNAs causes renal fibrosis by inducing EMT, EndMT, and other fibrogenic stimuli.The accumulative effects of hyperglycaemia, inflammatory cytokines, proteinuria, ageing, high blood pressure, and hypoxia result into alteration of miRNAs expression profiles.The altered miRNAs level causes the initiation of such transition program in normal kidney, finally fibrosis.Some of the miRNAs that are more abundant in the kidney compared with other organs include miR-192, miR-194, miR-204, miR-215, and miR-216.A critical role of miRNA regulation in the progression of glomerular and tubular damage and the development of proteinuria been suggested by studies in mice with podocytespecific deletion of Dicer [46].There was a rapid progression of renal disease with initial development of albuminuria followed by pathological features of glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis.It is likely that these phenotypes are due to the global loss of miRNAs because of Dicer deletion, but, given multiple miRNAs and their myriad targets, the precise pathways responsible require identification.These investigators also identified specific miRNA changes, for example, the downregulation of the miR-30 family when Dicer was deleted.Of relevance, the miR-30 family was found to target connective tissue growth factor, a profibrotic molecule that is also downstream of transforming growth factor (TGF)- [47].Thus, the targets of these miRNAs may regulate critical glomerular and podocyte functions.These findings have also been complemented by an elegant study revealing a developmental role for the miR-30 family during pronephric kidney development in Xenopus [48].Sun et al. [49] identified five miRNAs (-192, -194, -204, -215, and -216) that were highly expressed in human and mouse kidney using miRNA microarray.A recent report using new proteomic approaches to profile and identify miRNA targets demonstrated that miR-NAs repress their targets at both the mRNA and translational levels and that the effects are mostly relatively mild [50].The role of miR-192 remains controversial and highlights the complex nature of miRNA research.Kato et al. [51] observed increased renal expression of miR-192 in streptozotocin-(STZ-) induced diabetes and in the db/db mouse and demonstrated that transforming growth factor (TGF-1) upregulated miR-192 in mesangial cells (MCs).miR-192 repressed the translation of Zeb2, a transcriptional repressor that binds to the E-box in the collagen 12 (col12) gene.They proposed that miR-192 repressed Zeb2 and resulted in increased col12 expression in vitro and contributed to increased collagen deposition in vivo.These data suggest a role for miR-192 in the development of the matrix accumulation observed in DN.It is interesting that the expression of miR-192 was increased by TGF- in mouse MCs (mesangial cells), whereas, conversely, the expression of its target, Zeb2, was decreased [51].This also paralleled the increased Col1 2 and TGF- expression [51].These results suggested that the increase in TGF- in vivo in diabetic glomeruli and in vitro in MCs can induce miR-192 expression, which can target and downregulate Zeb2 thereby to increase Col1 2.This is supported by the report showing that miR-192 is upregulated in human MCs treated with high glucose [51].TGF- induced downregulation of Zeb2 (via miR-192) and Zeb1 (via potentially another miRNA) can cooperate to enhance Col1 2 expression via de-repression at E-box elements [51].In contrast to the above, other reports suggest the relationship between miR-192 and renal fibrosis may be more complicated.Krupa et al. [52] identified two miRNAs in human renal biopsies, the expression of which differed by more than twofold between progressors and nonprogressors with respect to DN, the greatest change occurring in miR-192 which was significantly lower in patients with advanced DN, correlating with tubulointerstitial fibrosis and low glomerular filtration rate.They also reported, in contrast to the Kato et al. [51] study in MCs, that TGF-1 decreased expression of miR-192 in cultured proximal tubular cells (PTCs).These investigators concluded that a decrease in miR-192 is associated with increased renal fibrosis in vivo.Interestingly, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) treatment also resulted in fibrogenesis but caused the induction of miR-192/215 and, consequently, decreased Zeb2 and increased E-cadherin.The contrasting findings above highlight the complex nature of miRNA research.Some of the differences may relate to models and/or experimental conditions; however, one often overlooked explanation is that some effects of miRNAs and inhibitors are likely to be indirect in nature.A recent report also showed that BMP6-induced miR-192 decreases the expression of Zeb1 in breast cancer cells [53].Thus, TGF- induced increase in the expression of key miRNAs (miR-192 and miR-200 family members) might coordinately downregulate E-box repressors Zeb1 and Zeb2 to increase Col12 expression in MCs related to the pathogenesis of DN.The proximal promoter of the Col1a2 gene responds to TGF- via smads and SP1.Conversely, the downregulation of Zeb1 and Zeb2 by TGF- via miR-200 family and miR-192 can affect upstream E-box regions.Because E-boxes are present in the upstream genomic regions of the miR-200 family, miR-200 family members may themselves be regulated by Zeb1 and Zeb2 [54].It is possible that the miR-200 family upregulated by TGF- or in diabetic glomeruli under early stages of the disease can also regulate collagen expression related to diabetic kidney disease by targeting and downregulating E-box repressors.miR-192 might initiate signaling from TGF- to upregulate miR-200 family members, which subsequently could amplify the signaling by further regulating themselves through down regulation of Ebox repressors.Such events could lead to progressive renal dysfunction under pathologic conditions such as diabetes, in which TGF- levels are enhanced.Conversely, there are several reports that miR-200 family members and miR-192 can be suppressed by TGF-, and this promotes epithelial-tomesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer and other kidneyderived epithelial cell lines via subsequent upregulation of targets Zeb1 and Zeb2 to repress E-cadherin [54,55].",

      "Additional evidence supporting a potentially important role for environmental modulation of genetic risk was found in previous population studies.For example, although some of the GWASidentified T2D loci could be replicated successfully in various populations (e.g., CDKAL1, HHEX, IGF2BP2, TCF7L2 and SLC30A8), more genetic variants have been identified only in some specific populations [26].T2D risk alleles showed extreme directional differentiation between different populations compared with other common diseases [29].Different T2D loci and loci frequencies across different populations may reflect the adaptation to the local environments and diets along with human migration [30].Therefore, the interplay between gene and environment leads to a more complex pathogenesis of T2D and related traits.These hypotheses are strongly supported by a number of recent GxE studies [7,11,31,32].For example, Qi et al. [31] generated a genetic risk score (GRS) using ten GWAS-identified SNPs and observed a significant interaction between the Western dietary pattern and GRS in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study.The Western dietary pattern was only positively associated with risk of T2D among men with a high GRS, but not with low GRS subjects.Another large meta-analysis of 14 cohort studies [32] revealed that dietary whole-grain intake potentially interacted with one GCKR variant (rs780094) for fasting insulin in individuals of European descent.Greater whole-grain intake was associated with a smaller reduction of fasting insulin in individuals with the insulin-raising allele of rs780094, compared to the non-risk allele.",
      "Gene\u2013exercise interaction in type 2 diabetes When studying gene\u2013environment interaction on the quantitative traits that underlie diabetes, the power to detect interaction is highly dependent on the precision with which non-genetic exposures are measured (Wareham et al 2002). Achievement of optimal glycaemic control is the focus of traditional treatment paradigms. Regular exercise, both aerobic (walking, jogging, or cycling) and resistance (weightlifting) training results in increased glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity and is a primary modality used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes patients (Sigal et al 2007).",
      "Gene-Environment Interaction  Evidence from the epidemiology of T2D overwhelmingly supports a strong environmental influence interacting with genetic predisposition in a synergistic fashion as has been recently reviewed [123], however current state-of-the-art methods for measuring environmental effects lack precision and can result in changes in statistical power to detect interaction [123,124].Since lifestyle factors are important in preventing diabetes [125,126], interaction of gene variants with measures of dietary intake and exercise have been selected for studies on gene-environment interaction.For example, HNF1B (rs 4430796) was shown to interact with exercise; low levels of activity enhanced the risk of T2D in association with absence of the risk allele, but there was no protective effect of exercise when the allele was present.It follows that subgrouping by genotype may serve to enhance risk prediction while considering gene-environment interaction as has been done for exercise [127].Also lifestyle including exercise modified the effect of a CDKN2A/B variant on 2-hour glucose levels in the Diabetes Prevention Program [128] but was not confirmed in the HERITAGE study using different measurements and phenotypes involving insulin sensitivity and \u03b2-cell function [129].The pro12ala PPARG variant also interacts with physical activity for effect on 2-hour glucose levels [130], which was confirmed in the smaller HERITAGE study [129].In addition, a relationship of dietary fat intake with plasma insulin and BMI differs by the pro12ala PPARG genotype [131].",
      "A person's risk of type 2 diabetes or obesity reflects the joint effects of genetic predisposition and relevant environmental exposures.Efforts to determine whether these genetic and environmental components of risk interact (in the statistical sense that joint effects cannot be predicted from main effects alone) 70 face challenges associated with measuring relevant exposures (diet and physical activity being notoriously difficult to estimate) and the effect of imprecision on statistical power. 71Although claims that statistical interactions reflect shared mechanisms (i.e., that the interacting factors act through the same pathways) are probably overstated, understanding the relative contributions of genetic and environmental components to risk is important.After all, environmental factors can be modified more readily than genetic factors.Genetic discoveries have provided a molecular basis for the clinically useful classification of monogenic forms of diabetes and obesity. 3,4Will the same be true for the common forms of these conditions?Probably not: as far as the common variants are concerned, each patient with diabetes or obesity has an individual \"barcode\" of susceptibility alleles and protective alleles across many loci.It is possible to show that the genetic profiles of lean subjects with type 2 diabetes and obese subjects with type 2 diabetes are not identical, but these differences appear to be inadequate for clinically useful subclassification. 22,72f efforts to uncover less prevalent, higher-penetrance alleles are successful, more precise classification of disease subtypes may become possible, particularly if genetic data can be integrated with clinical and biochemical information.For example, in persons presenting with diabetes in early adulthood, there are several possible diagnoses: various subtypes of maturity-onset diabetes of the young or mitochondrial diabetes, for example, as well as type 1 or type 2 diabetes.Assigning the correct diagnosis has both prognostic and therapeutic benefits for the patient (Table 3).",

      "Introduction  Genome wide association studies (GWAS) of type 2 diabetes mellitus and relevant endophenotypes have shed new light on the complex etiology of the disease and underscored the multiple molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenic processes leading to hyperglycemia [1].Even though these studies have successfully mapped many diabetes risk genetic loci that could not be detected by linkage analysis, the risk single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) have small effect sizes and generally explain little of disease heritability estimates [2].The poor contribution of risk loci to diabetes inheritance suggests a prominent role of environmental factors (eg.diet, physical activity, lifestyle), gene \u00c2 environment interactions and epigenetic mechanisms in the pathological processes leading to the deterioration of glycemic control [3,4].",
      "The literature on gene-environment interactions in diabetes-related traits is extensive, but few studies are accompanied by adequate replication data or compelling mechanistic explanations.Moreover, most studies are cross-sectional, from which temporal patterns and causal effects cannot be confidently ascertained.This has undermined confidence in many published reports of gene-environment interactions across many diseases; although interaction studies in psychiatry have been especially heavily criticized [3], many of the points made in that area relate to other diseases, not least to T2D, where the diagnostic phenotype (elevated blood glucose or HbA1c) is a consequence of underlying and usually unmeasured physiological defects (e.g., at the level of the pancreatic beta-cell, peripheral tissue, liver, and gut), and the major environmental risk factors are difficult to measure well.Nevertheless, several promising examples of geneenvironment interactions relating to cardiometabolic disease exist, as discussed below and described in Table 1, and interaction studies with deep genomic coverage in large cohorts are now conceivable; the hope is that these studies will highlight novel disease mechanisms and biological pathways that will fuel subsequent functional and clinical translation studies.This is important, because diabetes medicine may rely increasingly on genomic stratification of patient populations and disease phenotype, for which gene-environment interaction studies might prove highly informative.",
      "The genome is often the conduit through which environmental exposures convey their effects on health and disease.Whilst not all diseases act by directly perturbing the genome, the phenotypic responses are often genetically determined.Hence, whilst diseases are often defined has having differing degrees of genetic determination, genetic and environmental factors are, with few exceptions, inseparable features of most diseases, not least type 2 diabetes.It follows that to optimize diabetes, prevention and treatment will require that the etiological roles of genetic and environmental risk factors be jointly considered.As we discuss here, studies focused on quantifying gene-environment and gene-treatment interactions are gathering momentum and may eventually yield data that helps guide health-related choices and medical interventions for type 2 diabetes and other complex diseases.",

      "Predisposition is influenced by the level of certain environmental exposures, personal factors, access to good-quality primary care, and by genotype.Interactions between genetic and nongenetic risk factors are hypothesized to raise diabetes risk in a synergistic manner; reciprocally, health-enhancing changes in behavior, body composition, or medication may reduce the risk of disease conveyed by genetic factors.Defining the nature of these interactions and identifying ways through which reliable observations of gene-environment interactions (GEIs) can be translated into the public health setting might help 1) optimize targeting of health interventions to persons most likely to respond well to them, 2) improve cost-and health-effectiveness of existing preventive and treatment paradigms; 3) reduce unnecessary adverse consequences of interventions; 4) increase patient adherence to health practitioners' recommendations; and 5) identify novel interventions that are beneficial only in a defined genetic subgroup of the population.In this Perspective, we describe the rationale and evidence relating to the existence of gene-environment and genetreatment interactions in type 2 diabetes.We discuss the tried, tested, and oftenfailed approaches to investigating genelifestyle interactions in type 2 diabetes; we discuss some recent developments in gene-treatment interactions (pharmacogenetics); and we look forward to the strategies that are likely to dominate these fields of research in the future.We conclude with a discussion of the requirements for translating findings from these future studies into a form where they can be used to help predict, prevent, or treat diabetes.Here we describe the rationale and evidence concerning GEIs and gene-treatment interactions in type 2 diabetes, provide an interpretation of current findings and strategies, and offer a view for their future translation.",
      "T2DM results from the contribution of many genes [10] , many environmental factors [11] , and the interactions among those genetic and environmental factors.Physical activity and dietary fat have been reported to be important modifiers of the associations between glucose homeostasis and well-known candidate genes for T2DM [12] and there is reason to believe that a significant proportion of the susceptibility genes identified by GWASs will interact with these environmental factors to influence the disease risk.Florez et al. [13] reported that response to the Diabetes Prevention Program lifestyle intervention did not differ by genotype groups at TCF7L2 rs7903146 [13] .A more recent report from the Diabetes Prevention Program [14] showed that among 10 of the recently identified diabetes susceptibility polymorphisms (single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs), only CDKN2A/B rs10811661 was shown to marginally modify the effect of the lifestyle intervention on diabetes risk reduction.Similarly, the study of Brito et al. [15] reported that among 17 of the diabetes SNPs, only HNF1B rs4430796 significantly interacted with physical activity to influence impaired glucose tolerance risk and incident diabetes.",
      "Gene-Environment  Interactions.An risk of developing T2D is the product of interaction between the individual's genetic constitution and the environment inhabited by the individual.Whilst the contribution of genetic factors to disease risk is relatively easy to quantify, the impact of environmental exposure is less easily measured in a clinical setting.Nevertheless, efforts have been made to study the interactions between some of the known susceptibility loci for T2D and the environment, and these findings may be useful for the development of prediction models and tailoring clinical treatment for T2D [122,123].For example, for carriers of the risk allele for TCF7L2, diets of low glycaemic load [124,125] and a more intensive lifestyle modification regime (versus that recommended for nonrisk carriers) [61,62,126,127] have been shown to reduce the risk of T2D.Meaningful studies for gene-environment interactions will require samples of sufficient size to increase statistical power [128] and accurate methods for measuring environmental exposure, for example, the use of metabolomics to identify and assess metabolic characteristics, changes, and phenotypes in response to the environment, diet, lifestyle, and pathophysiological states.This information will allow the generation of better risk prediction models and personalisation/stratification of treatment, the holy grail of GWAS.",
      "Other aspects that have been overlooked in large GWAS on T2DM relate to environmental effects such as diet, physical activity, and stresses, which may affect gene expression.For example, fish oil may stimulate PPARG in much the same fashion as the thiazolidinedione class of drugs; however, studies on the interaction of the PPARG variant with dietary components have not been performed.The spectacular rise in the incidence of diabetes among Pima Indians and other populations as they adopt Western diets and lifestyles dramatically demonstrates the key role of the environment [12].Consequently, it could be expected that the effect of a common gene variant among populations that have very different diets and exercise habits might be totally different, thus explaining some instances of lack of replication. [4].Another variable that influences the statistical and real association of an SNP with a disease or response to a diet is epigenetic interaction.Epigenesis is the study of heritable changes in gene function that occur without a change in the DNA sequence, such as DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling.Both mechanisms can affect gene expression by altering the accessibility of DNA to regulatory proteins or complexes such as transcription factors, and they can be influenced by certain nutrients and by overall caloric intake.Thus, it can be expected that long-term exposure to certain diets could produce permanent epigenetic changes in the genome [7]."
