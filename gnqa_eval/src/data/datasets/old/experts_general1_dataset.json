    "To determine which gene in your QTL is causal for the trait, you can follow several steps. First, narrow down the QTL interval to a reasonable size. Then, sort through the genes within the interval to identify potential Quantitative Trait Genes (QTGs). This can be challenging as more than one gene may be involved and the function of some genes may be unknown. You can use techniques like LCMS to establish causal relationships between DNA loci and transcripts. Once potential QTGs are identified, you need to prove that a particular gene is involved in the quantitative trait under study. This can be done by complementation of a QTL, which can be achieved in several ways. You can also use mediation analysis to identify the causal gene between the genetic variant and the trait-of-interest. Finally, investigate whether the expression of these genes correlates with the phenotype(s) of interest. If the gene expression strongly correlates with the QTL phenotype, this further strengthens the assumption that this gene might be causal.",

    "GeneNetwork utilizes datasets containing phenotypes and genotypes for QTL mapping analysis. These datasets may include genetic, genomic, and phenotypic data. The data are often formatted and normalized, and come with metadata. The database also includes data on complex phenotypes ranging from gene expression to behavior in standard inbred strains, and panels of mouse recombinant inbred strains. Rat and Arabidopsis populations are also represented in the database.",
    "The ethical considerations surrounding prenatal genetic testing and selective termination of pregnancies based on genetic factors include the potential for implicit pressure on individuals to violate personal ethics to reduce financial burden on society, the risk of routinization of testing leading to social or medical expectations of testing in all eligible individuals, and the potential compromise of values of informed consent and individual autonomy. There are also cultural and religious beliefs to consider, as well as the potential psychological impact on parents who may feel guilt if they are carriers of genetic conditions. Furthermore, the decision to terminate a pregnancy based on genetic factors is a joint decision between parents, and the involvement of extended family members in this process varies greatly across different cultures.",
    "The potential benefits of gene editing technologies like CRISPR-Cas9 include the ability to modify genes for the treatment of diseases, improvement of crop species, and the development of personalized drug or cell therapies. It can also be used for functional screening in the development of therapies and for the study of molecular causes of ageing. However, there are risks associated with these technologies. These include off-target effects, which can lead to unwanted mutations, and the potential for wide-ranging deletions or recombination events. There's also a risk of triggering a P53 response leading to apoptosis in cycling cells, and the potential for subjects to generate antibodies to Cas9, which could limit gene therapies. Furthermore, the long-term safety of CRISPR genome editing in humans is yet to be determined."

      "Prior belief or knowledge about the number of true causal and true independent links that might be expected in a typical QTL, depending on the study design, should be considered to safeguard against high false-positive rates (low positive predictive values). In studies that involve mapping gene expression (eQTL), protein (pQTL) or metabolite (mQTL) traits, information about co-localization of QTL and genes that are functionally linked to the trait provides information about the likelihood of causal links.",
      "The next step is to investigate whether the expression of these genes correlates with the phenotype(s) of interest.This would suggest a chain of causality: a variant within a gene causes a change in its expression, and the expression of that gene correlates with expression of a phenotypic trait of interest.To do this, we created a correlation matrix between all genes within a QTL with a cis-eQTL in any brain tissue as well as the phenotypes that contributed to the QTL (Supplementary Table S6).Any gene with a cis-eQTL and a significantly correlated expression was considered a good candidate.If the gene only had a cis-eQTL and correlation in a single brain region, then it suggested that this brain region might also be of interest for the phenotype (adding another link to this chain).",
      "One possible approach to facilitate this endeavor is to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) that contribute to the phenotype and consequently unravel the candidate genes within these loci. Each proposed candidate locus contains multiple genes and, therefore, further analysis is required to choose plausible candidate genes. One of such methods is to use comparative genomics in order to narrow down the QTL to a region containing only a few genes. We illustrate this strategy by applying it to genetic findings regarding physical activity (PA) in mice and human.",
      "Network analyses We now have two QTL, and we have picked potentially interesting genes within each, but now we want to build up more evidence for which gene in our QTL interval is causal. The first, and most obvious way, is to see what genes our trait of interest correlates with, in tissues that we expect to be related to the trait. We calculated the Spearman\u2019s correlation between the trait BXD_17850 and all probes with expression data in T helper cells (GN319).",
      "Another approach to help to determine if a gene located near the mapped QTL would have effects to influence the quantitative trait will be to use genetically engineered mice to determine if altering the expression of a candidate gene will alter the phenotype of interest (38). However, it is possible that a quantitative trait is a combined effect of multiple genes located near the QTL (39).",
      "With a known QTL and a body of evidence suggesting possible roles for the affected gene, phenotypes can be predicted that may be modulated as a result of this sequence variation. If this phenotype is of interest, it can be directly measured and a traditional \u2018forward\u2019 QTL analysis carried out to confirm the prediction. Such an approach is extremely attractive when the enormous cost and time required for phenotyping a large panel is considered.",

      "A special case is the correlation of the target phenotype with the expression of the priorized gene(s) (RNA or protein amounts). This refers to colocalization of the QTL of the target phenotype with the eQTL position. Correlation can also be examined between the target QTL phenotype and expression of all genes in the QTL interval. If the gene expression strongly correlates with the QTL phenotype, this further strengthens the assumption that this gene might be causal (see Note 12).

      "QTL mapping of traits in mouse cohorts often ends up with a genetic locus, composed of a list of candidate genes. Several studies proposed the use of mediation analysis to identify the causal gene (mediator) between the genetic variant (independent variable) and the trait-of-interest (dependent variable) (Figure 1.4B) [7, 47, 61, 77]. Mediation analysis can be used either on gene expression levels to identify the regulatory mechanisms [7, 47, 61], or on phenotypic traits to discover the potential causal drivers contributing to the phenotypic variances [77] (Figure 1.4C upper).",
      "1a). Second-generation offspring are then phenotyped and genotyped, and linkage analysis is carried out to identify a region that is associated with the trait1. This approach has led to the identification of thousands of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for various phenotypes and diseases. However, each QTL region is large, often tens of megabases, and contains hundreds of genes. The process of identifying the causal variant and the gene involved is therefore difficult and costly. Of the thousands of QTLs identified, only a small fraction of genes has been identified. NIH-PA Author Manuscript  \u00a9 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",

For trans-QTLs, mQTLs, and cQTLs, the identification of the causal quantitative trait gene (QTG) is challenging due to the width of the QTLs.",
      "Once the QTL interval is reduced to a reasonable size, the next step in the process involves sorting through the genes within the interval and attempting to determine which is the QTG. This step is daunting because more than one gene may be involved and the function of some genes within the interval may be unknown. Until recently, this step emphasized the detection of polymorphisms within coding sequence (reviewed in Korstanje and Paigen, 2002 and Glazier et al. 2002); for a polymorphism that produces an amino acid substitution, one can often infer and then test for a functional consequence.",
      "To understand the genetic networks that underlie quantitative variation in the trait, it is also very important to discover genes whose expression is correlated with the trait after accounting for the known effects of the QTL on the trait. Many of these genes may have expression that is associated with QTL genotype, and would therefore be identified as important via the tests described above. Other  genes, however, may have expression values that are correlated with the trait but unassociated with genotype at the QTL.",
      "The approach is motivated by the fact that a research project is often focused on a specific classical quantitative trait. If a major QTL for this classical trait has been identified, it is often desirable to test whether this QTL is also associated with the transcription level of any genes, which will provide clues as to which genes belong to the pathway that the QTL uses to modulate the classical trait.",
      "Confirmation of Candidate Genes The next step is to prove that a particular gene is involved in the quantitative trait under study. This is done by complementation of a QTL, which can be achieved in several ways (9\u201311,40). In principle, transgenic complementation is the most straightforward. This approach has been used successfully to demonstrate that Pla2g2a was the correct candidate gene for Mom1, a modifier of the apcmin allele that causes adenomatous polyposis coli (41).",
      "So, how do you go about planning and performing a QTL study, and how do you identify the responsible gene within a QTL that you have identified? Generally, one starts by performing a strain survey to find two parental inbred strains that have a markedly different trait. One can now look up many different traits of inbred mice online at the Mouse Phenome Database (http://phenome. jax.org/pub-cgi/phenome/mpdcgi?rtn=docs/home). However, the trait you may want to study may not be present in wild type mice, so you may want to cross a mutant (or genetically engineered) strain onto several inbred strains.",
      "Along with correlations, this tool also derives new traits representing the principal components (Figure 2d). The user can add these principal components to their Trait Collection and proceed to perform QTL mapping, as in the case of a single trait QTL mapping.

Prioritizing Candidate Genes 7  Author Manuscript  Following the identification of a significant QTL, focus shifts to identifying the particular gene(s) that cause the QTL.",
      "The investigators first identified all QTLs associated with a classical phenotype and then winnowed the list of potentially associated gene-expression traits on the basis of their correlation or eQTL overlap with the phenotype of interest. Candidate genes then were ranked by applying  the LCMS technique, which uses the eQTL data to establish causal relationships between DNA loci and transcripts as well as between transcripts and phenotypes and finally identifies a model that best fits the data.",
      "The goal of QTL mapping is clearly the identification and eventual confirmation of candidate genes (QTGs) underlying the phenotype. The evidence required for such confirmation has engendered much discussion (Complex Trait Consortium 2003; Glazier et al. 2002) and is likely to vary depending on the nature of the trait and specific resources available to pin down underlying genes (e.g. availability of knock-in or knock-outs, specific antibodies, siRNA, etc.). The paucity of QTGs meeting such multifaceted standards is testament to the difficulty of narrowing the confidence interval sufficiently to identify and test suitable candidate genes (Flint et al."

      "Box 1. Sex-specific cytonuclear interactions  Several predictions about the nature of cytonuclear conflicts follow from the patterns of chromosomal inheritance (Table I).In a mated pair of animals, mtDNA is co-transmitted with half of the autosomal genes, two-thirds of the X-linked genes and none of the Y-linked genes [76].This predicts that, relative to the autosomal case, positive nuclear-mitochondrial interactions are more likely to evolve for X-linked loci whereas deleterious interactions between Y-linked genes and mtDNA should accumulate (or cannot be purged efficiently).",
      "In addition to genetic data, the 9p Network Cohort dataset also lists the gender for all 719 individuals.Of these individuals, 406 individuals are female and 313 are male, indicating a female bias (Binomial test p \u00bc 0.0006).This result was surprising considering that no female bias has been previously reported in 9p deletion and duplication syndromes.A possible explanation for the significant bias in the 9p Network Cohort dataset is the XY sex reversal phenotype, which is commonly observed in individuals with 9p deletion syndrome.This phenotype could lead to individuals with XY sex chromosomes being listed in the dataset as having a female gender.To further examine this hypothesis, we subset our dataset to include only the 236 individuals whose sex chromosomes are listed in their genetic information.For this much smaller subset, 125 individuals had female sex chromosomes and 111 had male sex chromosomes, indicating no significant sex bias (Binomial test p \u00bc 0.4).We also found no significant gender bias in this group (Binomial test p \u00bc 0.2), although we did confirm that four of the individuals with XY sex chromosomes had a gender of female.This comparison suggests that the XY sex reversal phenotype may be responsible for a female gender bias, but not a sex bias, in 9p deletion and duplication syndrome cohorts.",

      "Given such a high abundance of young male-biased genes, we asked whether their parental genes are also male-biased.We found that fewer parental genes of X-linked male-biased duplicates were also male-biased (20%, 2/10) compared to the parental genes of autosomal young male-biased duplicates (32%, 12/37).These data, despite the small sample sizes and being statistically not significant, may suggest that compared to autosomal young genes, X-linked young genes more often evolved novel male-biased expression.However, as the majority of young genes are the result of intrachromosomal duplication events, the pattern might also reflect the fact that X-linked old genes are less likely to be male-biased.",
      "A slight excess of X-linked female-biased genes was also detected (Fig. 2).Although most of them are old, a few recently arose on the X chromosome over 4 to 6 Myr in the common ancestor of the D. melanogaster and D. simulans clade (branch 5).This can be interpreted in the context of the dominance model of the sexual antagonism hypothesis.In this case, a dominant, X-linked gene that is favorable to females but disadvantageous for males can become fixed.The slow accumulation of female-biased genes in the X reflects an overall low rate of female gene origination, either due to a small dominance effect (the degree of dominance h!1/2), or a minor disadvantageous effect on males (the ratio of fitness effects of male relative to female k!0) along with a favorable effect on females (Vicoso and Charlesworth 2006, Equation 10).",
      "Regarding the second step in the evolution of male-biased genes, namely X!A transposition, sexual antagonism favorable for autosomal fixation (Vicoso and Charlesworth 2006) and/or MSCI (Lifschytz and Lindsley 1972;Betran et al. 2002) may play a role in this process.On the other hand, the within-chromosomal duplication rate is higher than the between-chromosomal duplication rate (Emerson et al. 2008), which may contribute to the slow pace of X!A transposition.",
      "It has been observed that male-biased genes in Drosophila are overrepresented on autosomes (Parisi et al. 2003;Ranz et al. 2003).Consistent with this result, a dynamic process that can explain the nonrandom autosomal distribution has also been observed, in which autosomal new genes with X-linked parental genes are often male-biased.Specifically, a significant excess of autosomal testisexpressed retrogenes were identified as RNA-duplicates of X-linked parental genes (Betran et al. 2002).Recently, similar X!A gene traffic was observed in the DNA-level duplication and relocation data set of the Drosophila genus (Vibranovski et al. 2009b), and was further confirmed for DNA-level duplications in the D. pseudoobscura neo-X chromosome (Meisel et al. 2009).In addition, selective extinction of neo-X linked male-biased genes also occurred in D. pseudoobscura (Sturgill et al. 2007).These three lines of genome-wide investigation support a common pattern of outof-X traffic for male-biased genes, resulting in an enrichment of these genes on autosomes in the long term.",
      "It has been reported that the initial manifestations of new gene emergence, namely polymorphic duplicates, occur at a lower frequency on the X chromosome, thus indicating that these duplicates are subject to stronger purifying selection (Emerson et al. 2008).Therefore, the excessive fixation of X-linked duplicates might not occur via neutral processes.Positive selection could have facilitated the fixation of X-linked young genes in addition to driving their subsequent sequence evolution.",
      "Occasionally, Y chromosome DNA is detected in the maternal plasma, and the fetus appears to have female genitalia on sonographic examination.The underlying mechanisms for this include a twin demise, a maternal disorder of sexual differentiation, such as Swyer syndrome, or that the mother has undergone a bone marrow or solid organ transplant from a male donor (Bianchi, 2018;Hartwig, Ambye, Sorensen, & Jorgensen, 2017).",

(2008) found American couples less inclined to involve extended relatives in the prenatal decision-making process than Native Palestinian couples.Both of these examples clearly indicate that cultural differences can impact the ways in which families negotiate prenatal decisions.Further research needs to investigate how different families engage in such discussions and decision-making processes, especially as prenatal testing becomes more common and better able to predict or prevent a wider range of genetic conditions.Tightly closed ethnic groups remain at high risk of serving as carriers for genetic mutations, but the management of this possibility varies greatly.For example, some Ashkenazi Jewish groups use screening for mutations for Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) as the basis for rabbinical marriage advice; whereas, children born to Amish families in Pennsylvania more often present with glutaric aciduria type 1 (GA1) but, given their beliefs, parents tend not to accept prenatal testing because of the implication of abortion (McKusick, 2000).",
      "Researchers studying factors that contribute toward a couple's choice to undergo prenatal testing have determined that partners base their decision upon several factors, including, but not limited to: parental beliefs about abortion, attitudes regarding disability and their \"perceptions of the usefulness of having the information revealed by genetic tests\" (Moyer et al., 1999, p. 522).Abortion beliefs constitute a key issue in the decision-making process.Even though a majority of parents receiving abnormal prenatal test results terminate their pregnancies (Redlinger-Grosse, Bernhardt, Berg, Muenke, & Biesecker, 2002), Moyer et al. noted that, when asked, more families reported that they would make use of prenatal testing than would be willing to terminate a pregnancy.The decision to continue or terminate a pregnancy after prenatal testing Downloaded by [University of the Sunshine Coast] at 10:32 05 August 2017 comprises a joint decision between both parents (e.g., Awwad et al., 2008;Beeson & Golbus, 1985); however, the nature of the conversations leading to the decision and the involvement of extended family members in the decisionmaking process remains highly understudied.",

M. Green, 2008).Test results provide potential parents with information that may lead to decisions involving intervention in the genetic makeup of future children.Although some families welcome such options, others may be unable or unwilling to consider such procedures, due to fi nancial concerns or moral/ethical/religious beliefs.",

      "To the extent that ''personal meaning'' gains wider acceptance as a legitimate criterion for expanding the availability of new tests and applications of genomic technology, the current policies and practices of restricting some genetic testing of children and mandating other tests will need to be reevaluated.There will be some parents who will find the information that becomes available through new technologies and data useful in shaping their parenting practices, while others will be more skeptical of their value.These disparate parental judgments may be independent of professional assessments of clinical validity and utility.Extrapolating from the empirical data about predictive genetic testing of children in at-risk families discussed earlier, we speculate that once comprehensive genomic testing of children becomes routine, the information may be more easily integrated by families than might be predicted.This is not meant to imply that whatever information parents want about their children should be provided carte blanche.Clearly, education and counseling will be crucial to ensure that families understand the limitations of the information.However, restrictions and mandates should be based on a criterion of risk of serious harm (Diekema, 2004).Given the lack of data confirming harm and the related data that indicate children may fare better than anticipated, such restrictions and mandates cannot be justified.Policies and practices will also need to clarify the role of the older adolescent in the decision-making process, although the issues related to balancing and assessing parental and adolescent interests and preferences goes beyond the focus of this article.This is also not meant to ignore the professional and moral obligation to educate parents and to help parents make good decisions on behalf of their children.It is morally appropriate for providers to strongly recommend particular tests in infancy and young childhood (i.e., PKU testing), and to strongly discourage other tests (e.g., ApoE testing of children for adult onset Alzheimer disease and heart disease because ApoE is not predictive but only provides an increased relative risk and has limited sensitivity and specificity) (Roberts, Cupples, Relkin, Whitehouse, & Green, 2005).Selective and directive recommendations are a routine aspect of pediatric practice.However, it will become increasingly important for professional organizations to begin to reconcile their support for mandatory genetic testing for some conditions and their support for restrictions for other conditions with the broad discretion that parents have and need in the health care arena in order to promote their children's well-being.",

      "Gene editing has gained considerable interest with the identification of the CRISPR-Cas9 system, 27 which allows for a targeted modification in the DNA sequence of an organism.Researchers can utilize their knowledge of the basic biology of the gene and its protein function to precisely change the DNA sequence, thus altering the protein function of the gene and allowing for edits to stay within the species.Researchers at the University of Missouri used the CRISPR-Cas9 system to modify the CD163 gene such that the PRRS virus is not able to replicate inside the pig. 28This slight modification of the swine genome through gene editing keeps the pigs from succumbing to PRRS which has an annual estimated loss to the United States swine industry of over $660 million per year.Despite this benefit, given the public's concerns over food safety, it is likely that approval for such technology is years away in the US, Canada and Europe.However, in some cultures, there is a wide range of non-livestock species that are consumed.Therefore, it is conceivable that these countries and cultures may be open to transgenic/gene edited livestock.They may see the importance of useful gene editing which may lead to approval and consumption of reasonable genetically edited animal products such as those with modifications that are already found in nature or those that offer a substantial welfare benefit to society.",

      "The notable accuracy and versatility of CRISPR-Cas for genome editing also opened the door to its use in preclinical and translational settings.In the latter case, CRISPR in vivo gene editing has led to several proof-of-concept studies that would have been unachievable without it, as in the first ever correction of inherited pathogenic mutations linked to degenerative disease in a living organism [22] and even shown to be possible in human embryos [23,24].It also has great potential in the field of precision medicine as large-scale population DNA sequencing studies have provided vast amounts of information linking particular diseases with specific genetic mutations which could, in theory, be targeted through CRISPR [25,26].This could be used during the identification and validation of potential DNA targets during the development of personalised drug or cell therapies, which will require the generation of engineered cell lines and/or animal models.Techniques such as HDR-mediated gene targeting are too labour intensive, with low targeting efficiencies and long times necessary for their establishment, and consequently are not ideally suited for drug discovery purposes.Conversely, CRISPR-Cas has been proven to be efficient for editing virtually any kind of cell line, from primary immune cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) [27,28].Additionally, CRISPR can also be used for functional screening in the development of combined inhibitory therapy aimed at strengthening the efficiency of targeted therapeutics.An example of the latter is shown in a study where a variation of the technology known as CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) was used in genome-wide scale to identify different survival pathways used by cancer cells after oncogene inactivation and allowing the identification of successful combination therapies [29].In terms of translational applications, the overall safety of CRISPR genome editing in humans will require long-term scrutiny before its adoption in the clinic.Nonetheless, a number of CRISPR-based clinical trials are currently in progress, including studies focused on targeting patients' own T cells in order to improve the immune response towards some forms of malignant cancer [30,31], and others aimed at correcting pathogenic mutations in the hematopoietic cells of patients with beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease [32].",
      "Caveats and Ethical Concerns of CRISPR-Cas Applications  Despite the presence of both a PAM sequence and a specific gRNA, the CRISPR-Cas9 system is not infallible.In fact, DSBs can occur at different sites in the genome, potentially causing so-called \"off-target\" effects.This eventuality remains to date the biggest concern in the field, as possible undesirable modifications must be properly identified and followed in order to guarantee safety for medical purposes.Nevertheless, there is still little evidence of the biological consequence of Cas9 off-target effects.Two recent studies describe new methods to investigate potential off-target effects in both mammals and plants [33,34].In both cases, whole-genome sequencing revealed that selective nucleotide changes, such as conversion of an adenine to a guanine, caused off-target occurrence very rarely, with a frequency comparable to the one of spontaneous mutations.However, substitution of a cytosine with a thymidine was linked to a sizable number of off-target mutations.This newly acquired information adds to the plethora of studies conducted on the safety of CRISPR, which altogether highlight the need for the establishment of clinical standards for the future use of genome-editing techniques in the clinic.Despite this and other technical challenges still ahead for CRISPR genome editing, the pace at which this technology has developed in recent years suggests many of these concerns could be addressed soon, as long as proper ethical guidelines and regulatory mechanisms are established.",

      "Caveats of advanced genome editing tools  Off-target effects.The DNA-binding domains of ZFNs and TALENs need to be very specific for the target site to avoid off-target cleavage, which results in unwanted mutations and potentially cytotoxic effects [27].CRISPR/Cas9 is also known to generate off-target alterations, albeit apparently at low incidence [28,29], since mispairing is allowed between the guide RNA and the genomic DNA.Nonetheless, caution is required in their design and use.Some strategies involving the optimization of the guide RNA/Cas9 include using of software tools to predict potential off-target sites (http://omictools.com/crispr-cas9-Figure1: Genome editing methodologies which can be applied to human pluripotent stem cells.Homologous recombination (HR), or the more advanced tools such as zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) or clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas system can be applied to human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) either to 1) create naturally occurring mutations or 2) repair a mutation to generate isogenic controls in hPSCs, to understand the function of a gene of interest.c1268-p1.html),truncating the guide RNA (<20 nucleotides) to decrease off-target mutagenesis [30], lowering the dosage of guide RNA and Cas9 plasmids, and decreasing the number of mismatches between the guide RNA and the genomic DNA.A \"double nick\" system with Cas9 nickase, which contains a single inactive catalytic domain, may also be used [31e33].",

      "INTRODUCTION  Genome editing technologies based on the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated endonuclease Cas9 enable rapid and efficient modification of endogenous genes in a variety of cell types, allowing for analysis of gene function in many organs in vivo.CRISPR-Cas9 induces DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) at single-guide RNA (sgRNA)-specific loci in the genome, which are repaired through either non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR) pathways.While NHEJ introduces unpredictable pattern of insertion or deletion (indel) mutations, HDR directs a precise recombination event between a homologous DNA donor template and the damaged DNA site (Cong et al., 2013;Cox et al., 2015;Doudna and Charpentier, 2014;Heidenreich and Zhang, 2016;Jinek et al., 2012;Mali et al., 2013;Sander and Joung, 2014;Wang et al., 2013;Yang et al., 2013).Thus, HDR can be used to precisely introduce sequence insertions, deletions or mutations by encoding the desired changes in the donor template DNA.",
      "CRISPR technology has rapidly changed the face of biological research, such that precise genome editing has now become routine for many labs within several years of its initial development.What makes CRISPR/Cas9 so revolutionary is the ability to target a protein (Cas9) to an exact genomic locus, through designing a specific short complementary nucleotide sequence, that together with a common scaffold sequence, constitute the guide RNA bridging the protein and the DNA.Wild-type Cas9 cleaves both DNA strands at its target sequence, but this protein can also be modified to exert many other functions.For instance, by attaching an activation domain to catalytically inactive Cas9 and targeting a promoter region, it is possible to stimulate the expression of a specific endogenous gene.In principle, any genomic region can be targeted, and recent efforts have successfully generated pooled guide RNA libraries for coding and regulatory regions of human, mouse and Drosophila genomes with high coverage, thus facilitating functional phenotypic screening.In this review, we will highlight recent developments in the area of CRISPR-based functional genomics and discuss potential future directions, with a special focus on mammalian cell systems and arrayed library screening.",

      "The recent development of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9 for experimental purposes has dismantled the perception that genome editing technology is off-limits for screening in mammalian systems (Heintze et al., 2013).Since this system employs the basic principle of Watson-Crick base pairing for gene targeting, generation of libraries with whole-genome target coverage is relatively easy and cost-effective.For instance, simple protocols are available to synthesize pooled lentiviral libraries by in silico design of oligonucleotides, which can then be cloned, packaged and delivered to cells by viral transduction (Paddison et al., 2004;LeProust et al., 2010).Similarly, the generation of arrayed libraries can be achieved by following protocols originally developed for arrayed shRNA library production that have been in use for a number of years (Moffat et al., 2006).All in all, the stage is set for CRISPR to make an enormous impact on genomic screening and thus scientific discovery in the coming years, and recent demonstrations of this system have shown great promise (Shalem et al., 2015).However, a number of technical challenges must be addressed in order to maximize the benefit of this technology.In this review, we will discuss current applications of CRISPR in functional genomics and provide a perspective on future developments in this area.",
      "Genome editing for crop improvement  Reports of CRISPR-Cas9-based genome editing first appeared in 2013 (Cong et al., 2013;Feng et al., 2013;Mao et al., 2013).Since then, genome editing technologies have proven to be powerful and efficient tools for the improvement of many crop species.At present, genome editing has been widely used to introduce/modify agronomically important traits, such as increased yield, improved nutritional quality, and resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses, in multiple crops, including rice, wheat, maize, tomato, and potato (Lu et al., 2017;Soyk et al., 2017;Tang et al., 2017;D'Ambrosio et al., 2018;Ye et al., 2018;Miao et al., 2019;Zhang et al., 2019;Zhong et al., 2019;Butt et al., 2020;Zhang et al., 2020c;Li et al., 2021b;Zhan et al., 2021).CRISPR-Cas-based genome editing has been extended to targeted mutagenesis, base editing, and precisely targeted gene/allele replacement or tagging in plants.mportantly, using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, transgenes present in the genomes of genome-edited plants can be removed by chromosomal segregation via a simple self-pollination or hybridization step.Gene editing technologies continue to be developed and utilized (Mao et al., 2013;Lu and Zhu, 2017;Lu et al., 2020)."
