    "Apoptosis, also known as cell suicide or programmed cell death, is a biological process in multicellular organisms that allows specific cells to be removed during the development of complex tissues, or potentially dangerous damaged cells to be destroyed for the benefit of the whole organism. It is characterized by a sequence of well-defined events resulting in cell destruction and is necessary for normal cell turnover. It is also essential to various other biological processes.",
    "For mammals, DNA can be extracted using a DNA Isolation Kit for Mammalian Blood, following the manufacturer's instructions. This process typically involves mixing blood with lysis buffer and Proteinase K, followed by the addition of isopropanol and Inhibitor Removal Buffer. The DNA is then washed, centrifuged, and the supernatant discarded. The remaining pellet, which contains the purified genomic DNA, is diluted in TE buffer.  For plants, the mixed alkyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (MATAB) procedure can be used. This involves grinding plant material in liquid nitrogen, incubating it in extraction buffer, and then purifying it with chloroform:isoamylalcohol. The DNA extracts are then precipitated with isopropanol and resuspended in a buffer. The extracts are further purified on anion exchange columns.",
    "A genetic marker is a measurable polymorphic sequence of DNA whose chromosomal location is known. They often have no known functional significance but are used as pointers to a particular chromosomal location. They are used to track the inheritance of genes and can be a gene or some section of DNA with no known function.",
    "The process of finding a genetic marker followed by a quantitative trait loci (QTL) involves several steps. First, a population is developed for genetic mapping. This population can be a segregating population or a permanent population. The population is then genotyped using molecular markers. Next, the population is phenotyped for an interested trait. QTL analysis is then conducted using statistical procedures to find markers linked to the QTL. This involves single-marker regression across all chromosomes, where a hypothetical QTL is evaluated at the location of each marker locus. The significance of that QTL is estimated from a likelihood ratio statistic. A permutation test is then conducted to establish genome-wide significance criteria for the trait. The result is a list of marker loci that show a significant association with the trait. These loci are most likely to be near QTLs. The goal of QTL mapping is to identify regions of the genome that harbor genes relevant to a specified trait."

      "INTRODUCTION  Asthma is a chronic disease of the airways defined by its symptoms, which include reversible airflow obstruction, inflammation, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness.The ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans made reference to the symptoms of asthma, and today the disease is estimated to affect 235-334 million people worldwide (44,53).",
      "The atopic triad.Perhaps the most widely recognized pattern of co-occurrence is the one of asthma, atopic dermatitis (eczema), and allergic rhinitis (hay fever), which together are referred to as the atopic triad and characteristically present clinically in a temporal sequence known as the atopic march.Within this sequence, atopic dermatitis is typically the first component to manifest, with approximately 20-30% of individuals with mild disease and 70% of those with severe disease going on to develop asthma.Individuals who undergo this distinctive sequence of disease progression frequently exhibit a more severe and persistent phenotype, with increased risk of allergen sensitization.",
      "Clinically, asthma is characterized by episodes of coughing, chest tightness, wheezing, dyspnea, or sputum production.Often, asthma sufferers experience a combination of these symptoms, or some symptoms more than others.Pulmonary breathing tests typically demonstrate variable airway obstruction and hyperreactivity, but may be normal, even in patients with severe and uncontrolled disease [8].Thus, the diagnosis of asthma, which is based on general clinical symptoms and variable lung function testing, is non-specific and heavily dependent on clinical history.Within the \"umbrella\" diagnosis of asthma there exists a diverse array of differing clinical phenotypes [9].For example, childhood asthma is often associated with personal and parental atopic diseases (i.e., atopic dermatitis, food allergy, eosinophilic esophagitis, allergic rhinitis), viral infections, and tobacco smoke exposure [10].Alternatively, adult-onset asthma is less associated with atopic disease [11,12], but more associated with female sex [13], sinus disease [14], and preceding respiratory infections such as pneumonia [15].In addition, adult-onset disease is often of higher severity [12,16] with a faster and more persistent decline in lung function [17].Moreover, although severe patients are found in every demographic and age group, the most common phenotype is an adult female that is older and obese [18].",
      "Introduction  An estimated 9% of children and 6% of adults in the United States have asthma [1].The total number of asthma sufferers worldwide is estimated to be over 300 million, with an additional 100 million expected to develop asthma by 2025 [2][3][4][5].Developed countries are the most affected, with some of the highest rates found in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and the Republic of Ireland [3].Asthma prevalence is rising significantly in developing countries in transition to a more Western lifestyle [3].In 2007, the cost of disease in the United States was estimated to be $56 billion in relation to medical expenses, missed days of work, and early deaths [1].The rate of asthma deaths has likely plateaued, but is still as high as 250,000 per year worldwide [6].Morbidity and mortality are particularly high in ethnic minorities living below or near the poverty line, and African American children had a death rate 10 times that of non-Hispanic white children in 2015 [7].Thus, asthma is a costly, growing health problem associated with high morbidity and mortality.",
      "Getting accurate estimates of exposures is difficult, whether this is air pollution or toxins in our food and drink, but these are important questions. Rutter: That is an important point. From the twin study data it is clear that environmental effects account for quite a lot of the variance on all the multifactorial disorders. Yet the kinds of measures that are used aren\u2019t terribly solid. They include broad thing such as socio-economic status (SES). Even where there are good measures the care taken in testing for environmental mediation is usually poor.",
      "Bronchiolitis, a disease that happens in the first year of life in many infants, is strongly associated with subsequent asthma. We ascertained it in the first years of life and have been following these people to age 25 now. For the people who had bronchiolitis and now have asthma, their parents recall much better that they had bronchiolitis than those who don\u2019t have asthma now. It is at least twice more. Extraordinarily, some of these latter parents don\u2019t recall that they took their child to the doctor in the fi rst year of life.",
      "If you arrive in the USA when you are young you have almost the same prevalence of asthma as an adult as those who are born in the USA and who are not Mexican. But if you arrive at older ages you have less asthma. If you arrive at the age of 20 you have the same asthma risk as those born in Mexico (Eldeirawi et al 2005). Kotb: This is extremely interesting. There is a relationship between depression and the immune system. This especially applies to natural killer (NK) cells, which are the main cells that fight cancers.",
      "A colleague of mine in Georgia found this may have a protective effect against later development of asthma (Ownby et al 2002). Martinez: We find significantly decreased likelihood of asthma if you have a dog in a home, but not if you have a cat. The reason for this is not that I hate cats, which I do, but most likely because cats are stealth hunters, and they have to be very clean. Dogs are collective hunters and they don\u2019t care if they smell.",

      "This is most common during the rainy season when aerosols are created, which results in repeated inhalation of Bp [43, 44]. Environmental sampling studies reveal there is a positive association between the prevalence of disease and the degree of environmental contamination [7]. In addition to environmental factors, data suggests that host factors play an important role in mounting an immune response against infectious diseases [45] such as melioidosis. While healthy persons can contract melioidosis, most patients in endemic regions have an underlying predisposition [28], which suggests that the immunological status of the patient can influence disease initiation and progression [15].",
      "Sensitivity analysis  We did two sets of post-hoc sensitivity analyses to assess the effects of potential poor recall of age of onset among individuals with adult-onset asthma, and the effects of misclassification of COPD as asthma among the adultonset cases, even with exclusion of cases with a reported diagnosis of COPD, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis.First, to assure that the adult-onset cases did not include a significant proportion of childhood-onset asthma in which symptoms remitted in early life but then relapsed in adulthood, we replaced adult-onset cases with increasing proportions of randomly selected childhood-onset cases, and then tested for association at the two most significant childhood onset-specific loci.This procedure was repeated 20 times for each proportion to quantify the sampling variability (appendix pp 7-8).Second, we did two analyses in which we removed either individuals with ages of asthma onset between 46 and 65 years or adult-onset cases and controls with FEV\u2081/FVC <0\u202270.For each, we compared p values and ORs with the GWAS including all adult-onset cases (appendix pp 8-9).",

      "8 The socio-ecologic framework posits that various aspects of a child\u2019s environment directly and indirectly impact the child\u2019s health and development.9 Drawing on this framework, Beck and colleagues10 examined several biologic, social and ecologic variables to provide a greater understanding of factors influencing asthma-related hospital readmissions for black children compared to their white counterparts. The study revealed that black children were over two times as likely to be readmitted for an asthma-related illness compared to white children; this resulted from significant differences in almost every socio-ecologic variable measured, including disease management practices and access to primary care.",

      "Apoptosis, or controlled cell death [62], is another major stressed-cell response, and was also represented in our results (Fig. 9e).A large body of direct evidence points to apoptosis as one of the main routes of RPE degeneration in AMD [63].Induction of apoptosis upon stress is dictated by the action of master regulator p53, and it was recently shown that aging increases the activity of p53 in RPE cells and the likelihood for apoptotic cell death [64].Consistent with this evidence, we found association with pathways in Transcriptional regulation by TP53 group (Fig. 9d).In particular, Regulation of TP53 activity through methylation was among the top pathway in our association analysis (Table 1), suggesting that p53 modification by methylation and the closely related histone modifications [Protein lysine methyltransferases (PKMTs) methylate histone lysine in Fig. 9e] play important roles in RPE apoptosis regulation.In the intrinsic apoptotic pathway induced by oxidative stress, cytochrome c is released from mitochondria into the cytosol, binding and activating caspases, the main proteases central to apoptotic action.We found association in pathways involving 'inhibitor of apoptosis' (IAP) and its negative regulator 'second mitochondrial activator of caspases' (SMAC) [65], which suggests that disruption to regulatory mechanisms preventing apoptosis in RPE cells may play roles in AMD.",

      "14 Apoptosis is caused by the activation of the caspase cascade, which is initiated by two signaling routes (stress-induced death and death-domain receptor-induced death) (Domen 2001). This process can be prevented by antiapoptotic molecules, such as Bcl-2 (Domen and Weissman 2000). Direct evidence for the involvement of apoptosis in HSC number regulation came from the findings that overexpression of the anti-apoptotic gene bcl-2 led to increased numbers of Thy-1.1low, Sca-1+, c-kit+, Lin- cells, a population with long-term multi-lineage repopulation potential (Domen et al. 2000).",
      "Several lines of evidence have indicated that apoptosis acts as an important regulator of stem cells. First of all, expression of some apoptosisrelated genes were detected in human and/or murine HSCs (Domen 2001). Secondly, targeted disruption of some of these genes in null and dominant negative mutant mice interfered with normal apoptotic processes in HSCs. For example, overexpression of Bcl-2, a negative regulator of apoptosis, increased not only the numbers and competitive repopulation capabilities of HSCs, but also the resistance of HSCs to apoptosis induced by ionizing radiation (Domen and Weissman 2003).",
      "Apoptosis  Cell suicide, or apoptosis, is a well-studied biological phenomenon in multicellular organisms that allows specific cells to be removed during the development of complex tissues, or potentially dangerous damaged cells to be destroyed for the benefit of the whole organism.The lack of an apparent evolutionary benefit for such a process in a single-celled organism initially caused controversy about the presence of an apoptotic pathway in yeast.Today, however, a number of yeast orthologues to mammalian apoptosis genes have been discovered and apoptotic-like cell death has been linked to mating, colony formation, and aging (Buttner et al. 2006;Eisenberg et al. 2007;Frohlich et al. 2007).With respect to aging, both replicatively and chronologically aged cells that die have increased ROS and display apoptotic phenotypes (Fabrizio et al. 2004a;Herker et al. 2004;Laun et al. 2001).",

      "When a cell harbors such severe DNA damage that it is beyond repair, it is disposed of through apoptosis.Alternatively, DNA damage can induce cellular senescence, the irreversible cessation of mitosis.Both processes are critically dependent on p53, which is known as the guardian of the genome [3] .DNA damage may also trigger autophagy, a cellular catabolic process that maintains homeostasis [4] .It should be noted that under normal conditions cells are rarely exposed to very high doses of DNAdamaging agents, which may be the explanation why we do not age and die because we run out of cells.However, aging is associated with some atrophy [1] and it is conceivable that at older ages bursts of DNA damage, for example from free radical reactions associated with inflammation, do occur and give rise to an increasingly high rate of apoptosis or cellular senescence.While there is some evidence for increased apoptosis and cellular senescence at old age, it is doubtful that under normal conditions this would lead to a significant loss of functional cells.",
      "Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, literally eliminates cells at risk for neoplastic transformation.Senescence, by contrast, permanently arrests their growth.Both processes are controlled by the p53 tumor suppressor protein (Amundson, Myers, & Fornace, 1998;Bringold & Serrano, 2000;Hickman, Moroni, & Helin, 2002;Itahana, Dimri, & Campisi, 2001).p53 is a transcriptional regulator that both transactivates and transrepresses target genes in response to stress (Prives & Hall, 1999;Ryan, Phillips, & Voudsen, 2001).These target genes, in turn, stimulate DNA repair, transient cell cycle arrest, permanent cell cycle arrest (senescence) or cell death (apoptosis), depending on cell type, degree and type of damage, and other variables.In contrast, cells that lack normal p53 regulation or function -for example, tumor cells -tend to die in response to telomere dysfunction.Some normal human cells, on the other hand, undergo a senescence growth arrest.In either case, when present, p53 is crucial for mediating the cellular response to telomere dysfunction (Yaswen & Stampfer, 2002) (Fig. 4).",
      "Cell death, and in particular apoptosis, can be caused by a number of mechanisms including loss of growth factors and excitotoxicity (e.g. , Bhutta and Anand, 2002; Nikolic\u0301 et al. , 2013). It is of interest therefore, that proximal to the region of the QTL there are several genes that are related to growth factors including the latent transforming growth factor protein 2 (ltbp2), placental growth factor (pgf), and transforming growth factor beta (Tgf beta).",

      "It has been known that mitochondria play a central role in the life and death of cells (Kroemer & Reed, 2000).Apoptosis was observed in developmentally arrested embryos by 72 h, but not at 24 h after FCCP treatment, despite considerable telomere attrition at this early stage, suggesting that telomere attrition occurs prior to apoptosis and may serve as an intermediate step between mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis.These results also suggest that telomere shortening may signal apoptosis (Lee et al ., 1998;Karlseder et al ., 1999).",
      "Cell Death  A form of programmed cell death, apoptosis is necessary for normal cell turnover and is essential to a plethora of other biological processes.Apoptosis can be executed via Bcl-2 activation of caspases, via signals from the death receptor on the plasma membrane, or via induction by granzyme B secreted from cytotoxic T cells (Tc cells) [35].Endonucleases and proteases are activated by active caspases, eventually leading to the death of the cell.With age, however, apoptotic activity changes.In heart [36], kidney [37], skeletal muscle [38], and Tc cells [39], increased apoptosis has been reported, perhaps contributing to loss of cellularity in these tissues.This escalation across various tissues may be attributed to the increased production of free radicals [40] and furthermore exacerbated by the accumulation of DNA damage in the aged cells [41].As the risk increases for cells to turn cancerous and dysfunctional with advancing age, increased apoptosis in aged cells is argued to be a defense strategy.In other tissues, such as the colon, apoptosis appears to decrease with age perhaps contributing to the accumulation of senescent cells and age-associated carcinogenesis [42].",
      "The regulation and execution of apoptosis in endothelial cells is a complex process involving paracrine factors, membrane receptors, interaction of pro-and anti-apoptotic factors and cysteinyl aspartate-specific proteases (caspases).Recent studies suggest that in aging there is an imbalance in the expression of pro-and anti-apoptotic genes resulting in an enhanced apoptosis in the myocardium (19), central nervous system (24), skeletal muscle (10), lung (33), and liver (2,33).Yet, age-related alterations in the expression of pro-and anti-apoptotic genes in coronary arteries have not been elucidated.",

      "As described by Hermalin (1999), if genetic markers are modeled as part of an individual's physiological structure, they can provide controls for predisposing factors that affect more proximate mid-level markers of function as well as downstream health outcomes.This potential benefit of genetic information-i.e., its power in explicating the black box of Figure 11-1-may outweigh, or at least precede, its near-term potential for discovering genetic links to chronic disease.As discussed by Weiss (1998b), the situation with chronic disease differs from single locus disorders that are inherited following well-identified Mendelian rules.In general, we cannot expect to find relationships that are even as straightforward as the APOE links to cardiovascular and Alzheimer's disease.Variation across populations, difficulty in identifying a small enough area on the chromosome to search for disease-associated genes, and the problems inherent in identifying continuous outcomes with particular genes may limit finding the connections.",

      "Nowadays many different cost-efficient genotyping solutions (including sequencing and Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms arrays) have opened the way to systematic genome-wide fine mapping of quantitative traits (Quantitative Trait Locus or QTL mapping). The process of QTL mapping (Figure 1) consists in searching for genome regions that influence the value of a given trait. For example, identifying a QTL for plant height means finding a DNA region at which the plants that carry a certain allele tend to be significantly higher or lower than those carrying another allele.",
      "QTLs are regions within the genome whose genetic variation modulates quantitatively a phenotype characteristic of the particular trait under study (Lynch and Walsh, 1998). Determining the association between variations in specific disease phenotypes or a trait, with variations in genotypes of a reference population can be used to locate a QTL. One of the methods used for mapping QTLs associated with complex traits is genetic markers-trait association. Genetic markers associated with certain loci can be inherited in linkage disequilibrium. Generating populations with linked loci in disequilibrium is achieved though either crosses between inbred lines, or use of the out-bred populations.",
      "Often, the first step in analysis of new trait data is single-marker regression across all chromosomes. A hypothetical QTL is evaluated at the location of each marker locus, and the significance of that QTL is estimated from a likelihood ratio statistic (LRS) (Haley and Knott, 1992). For this analysis, WebQTL automatically does a permutation test to establish genomewide significance criteria for the trait (Churchill and Doerge, 1994).",
      "One possible approach to facilitate this endeavor is to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) that contribute to the phenotype and consequently unravel the candidate genes within these loci. Each proposed candidate locus contains multiple genes and, therefore, further analysis is required to choose plausible candidate genes. One of such methods is to use comparative genomics in order to narrow down the QTL to a region containing only a few genes. We illustrate this strategy by applying it to genetic findings regarding physical activity (PA) in mice and human.",

      "QTLs can be identified through their genetic linkage to visible marker loci with genotypes that can be readily classified [94, 97]. As such, markers that are genetically linked quantitative trait will segregate more often with trait values, whereas unlinked markers will lack an association with the phenotype [94, 98]. The principal goal of a QTL analysis is to identify all QTLs linked to a trait and discern whether phenotypic differences are mainly due to a few loci with large effects, or many loci with small effects [98].",

      "Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) mapping To map QTL, we used 934 AXB/BXA genetic informative markers obtained from http://www. genenetwork.org. For all the in vitro measurements and gene expression linkage analysis, a genome-wide scan was performed using R/qtl [57]. Significance of QTL logarithm-of-odds (LOD) scores was assessed using 1000 permutations of the phenotype data [114] and the corresponding p-values reported. For the cellular phenotypes, QTL significance was reported at a genome-wide threshold corresponding to p < 0.05.",
      "Typically one may obtain a location known to derive from only one of the two parent strains that contains a chromosomal region that correlates with a trait of interest. Since the actual gene and gene product will frequently remain unknown, the region is referred to as quantitative trait locus (QTL), and is simply named for the trait itself (Alberts & Schughart, 2010). Growing sets of strain-dependent marker locations in established RI strains are continually updated in online repositories.",
      "By definition, a quantitative trait locus is a chromosomal region that contains a gene, or genes, that regulate a portion of the genetic variation for a particular phenotype (Wehner et al. 2001). The goal of QTL mapping is to identify regions of the genome that harbour genes relevant to a specified trait. QTL map locations are commonly determined by initial screening of mice with specific genetic characteristics, such as recombinant inbred strains, the F2 of two inbred strains, or recombinant congenic strains (Flint 2003).",

      "QTL linkage studies are conducted in order to map a region or regions of the genome which affect a continuous or quantitative trait. In agriculture, as soon as markers linked to QTL are found for economically important traits, these markers can be used for selecting individuals in breeding programmes. In human studies, the aim is often to identify markers indicating disease susceptibility. Current techniques for measuring markers are usually relatively slow and laborious. Newer DNA technology, such as SNP or single nucleotide polymorphisms (Kwok, 2001b; Patil et al.",
      "Genomic regions linked to complex traits can be identified by genetic mapping and quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis (Shehzad and Okuno 2014). 7 QTL mapping QTL mapping with molecular markers is the first strategy in genetic studies. In plant breeding, QTL mapping is an essential step required for marker-assisted selection (Mohan et al. 1997; Shehzad and Okuno 2014). The fundamental idea underlying QTL analysis is to associate genotype and phenotype in a population exhibiting a genetic variation (Broman and Sen 2009).",
      "Four steps of QTL mapping are (1) development a  W  population, (2) genotyping the population using molecular markers, (3) phenotyping the population for an interested trait, and (4) QTL analysis using statistical procedures to find  IE  markers linked to the QTL (Bernardo 2002). PR EV  Populations used for genetic mapping can be a segregating population (F2 and backcross) or a permanent population (double haploids or recombinant inbred lines). Recombinant inbred lines (RILs) are developed by selfing of individual progenies of the F2 plants until homozygosity is achieved (F7-F8).",
      "This tool allows systems genetic analysis of single genes or small sets of genes using a bottom-up approach. relations define quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Because the marker is not typically the actual site of the polymorphism, interpolative methods have been developed to estimate the distance of the QTL from the marker and the strength of the association. Using multiple-regression and model-fitting methods, the true complexity of the phenotypic variation can be modeled through the consideration of multiple loci and environmental factors as predictors [13]."
