    "question": "What loci and gene variants modulate normal variation in lifespan, and in which cases is this sex-specific (GxS)?",
    "statements": [
        "The study identified 10 genomic loci that influence healthspan, parental lifespan, and longevity.",
        "The loci include FOXO3, SLC4A7, LINC02513, ZW10, and FGD6.",
        "The life-extending variant near FOXO3 is associated with a delay in the age at menarche.",
        "The study did not perform sex-stratified analyses, so it's unclear if there are other sex-specific longevity-related genetic variants.",
        "The delay in age at menarche suggests a possible sex-specific effect of the life-extending variant near FOXO3.",
        "The study did not find any other sex-specific longevity-related genetic variants.",
        "The identified loci may modulate normal variation in lifespan, and some of these variants may have a sex-specific effect.",
        "The study provides evidence that genetic variants near FOXO3, SLC4A7, LINC02513, ZW10, and FGD6 may contribute to the regulation of lifespan.",
        "The study suggests that the life-extending variant near FOXO3 may have a sex-specific effect, but further research is needed to confirm this.",
        "The study highlights the complexity of longevity regulation and the need for further research to understand the interplay between genetic and environmental factors that influence lifespan."
