    "statements": [
        "Significant quantitative trait loci (QTLs) have been found in aging studies",
        "Lfdr1 is a QTL found on chromosome 7 that affects lifespan and fertility in response to dietary restriction and has suggestive effects on fuel efficiency.",
        "Fedr1 and Fedr2 are QTLs identified on chromosomes 9 and 15, respectively, that have significant effects on fuel efficiency in response to dietary restriction.",
        "QTLs associated with age-related thymic involution have been identified in a study using C57BL/6 J X DBA/2 J (BXD) recombinant inbred (RI) strains of mice.",
        "Dietary restriction has been found to have an effect on lifespan and fertility, and QTLs associated with these traits have been identified.",
        "Fuel efficiency has been found to be associated with QTLs in response to dietary restriction.",
        "Age-related thymic involution has been found to be associated with QTLs.",
        "The BXD recombinant inbred strains of mice have been used in a study to identify QTLs associated with age-related thymic involution.",
        "QTLs have been identified in aging studies using a variety of techniques, including genomic analysis.",
        "The study of QTLs in aging has implications for understanding the genetic basis of aging and potentially identifying targets for interventions to promote healthy aging."
