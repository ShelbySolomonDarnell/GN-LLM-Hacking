    "statements": [
        "The genotypes related to Alzheimer's and dementia that have commonalities with those for aging include a locus on chromosome 17 associated with the age at onset.",
        "A specific variant in CCL11 is associated with Alzheimer's disease.",
        "APP, PSEN1, PSEN2, and APOE genes are associated with Alzheimer's disease.",
        "The APOE gene is the strongest genetic risk factor for later onset Alzheimer's disease.",
        "The heritability of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is estimated to be ~60-80%.",
        "The genetics of LOAD risk is driven by a large proportion of individual differences.",
        "The genes associated with Alzheimer's disease are also associated with early-onset Alzheimer's disease.",
        "The age at onset of Alzheimer's disease is associated with a locus on chromosome 17.",
        "The genetic risk factor for later onset Alzheimer's disease is the APOE gene.",
        "The heritability of LOAD is estimated to be ~60-80%, suggesting that genetics play a significant role in the development of the disease."
