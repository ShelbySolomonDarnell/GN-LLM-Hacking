Genetic and genomic research into longevity is a fundamental human life expectancy extending geroscience study.
Explanation: Yes, the context states that genetic and genomic studies into longevity are inspired by the fact that healthy lifespan has proved to be remarkably plastic in animal models, and major pathways of lifespan regulation have been identified. These studies have been conducted in humans to identify corresponding candidate human genes with genetic, genomic and epigenetic studies into ageing and longevity.
Final verdict: Yes
The study of biomarkers related to aging is a fundamental human life expectancy extending geroscience study.
Explanation: Yes, the context states that the identification of longevity-related biological markers is critical to an in-depth understanding of the mechanisms of carrier protection against common disease and/or of the retardation of the process of aging.
Final verdict: Yes
Deep phenotyping is a fundamental human life expectancy extending geroscience study.
Explanation: Yes, the context states that human studies now also include the response of nutrient sensing systems to the application of dietary and physical challenges, which is a form of deep phenotyping.
Final verdict: Yes
The use of novel technologies like next-generation sequencing is a fundamental human life expectancy extending geroscience study.
Explanation: Yes, the context states that the possibilities to further exploit these findings are rapidly increasing through the use of novel technologies, such as next-generation sequencing. Genomic research is progressively being integrated with biomarker studies on aging, including the application of (noninvasive) deep phenotyping and omics data -generated using novel technologies -in a wealth of studies in human populations.
Final verdict: Yes
Environmental factors, lifestyle, and heritability play a role in human lifespan variation, and studying them is a fundamental human life expectancy extending geroscience study.
Explanation: Yes, the context states that human lifespan variation is mainly determined by environmental factors, whereas the genetic contribution is 25-30% and expected to be polygenic. The context also states that heritability studies have convincingly demonstrated that at least some fraction of human lifespan is heritable.
Final verdict: Yes
Candidate gene approaches are used in genetic and genomic research into longevity.
Explanation: Yes, the context states that genetic and genomic studies into longevity have been performed based on a hypothesis, referred to as a candidate gene approach.
Final verdict: Yes
Genome-wide analyses are used in genetic and genomic research into longevity.
Explanation: Yes, the context states that alternatively, explorative genome-wide analyses have been applied in which genetic variation and gene transcription across the complete genome are being studied for associations with longevity and related traits.
Final verdict: Yes
