Evaluating a candidate gene for mouse lifespan involves conducting gene mapping methods: Yes, the context states that the study used gene mapping methods to test hypotheses about aging and to develop new animal models that will be useful for testing well-specified hypotheses about the molecular basis for age-dependent changes.
Mouse lifespan can be used as a surrogate for aging in evaluating a candidate gene: Yes, the context states that the goal is to use mouse life span as a crude surrogate for aging itself, reasoning that genetic alleles that extend life span well beyond the median for the tested population may be operating via an influence on aging itself.
The evaluation process involves studying the genetic contributions to mortality rates: Yes, the context states that genetic contributions to mortality rates are of great interest and may aid in the understanding of disease etiology and the process of aging itself.
Sex-specific analyses should be conducted to assess the relationship between the gene and lifespan: Yes, the context states that since QTL for longevity in mice have shown strong sex specificity, the study conducted sex-specific analyses.
Changes in pathology associated with the loci are determined to evaluate the gene's effect on lifespan: No, the context does not mention that changes in pathology associated with the loci are determined to evaluate the gene's effect on lifespan.
A large population of mice is required for the study to produce reliable results: Yes, the context states that the goal has been to use gene mapping methods to test hypotheses about aging and to develop new animal models that will be useful for testing well-specified hypotheses about the molecular basis for age-dependent changes. In the absence of a validated battery of biomarkers of aging, the study has to use mouse life span as a crude surrogate for aging itself, reasoning that genetic alleles that extend life span well beyond the median for the tested population may be operating via an influence on aging itself.
The results of the study are compared to Mendelian expectations: Yes, the context states that the study found loci on Chr 13 in males and on Chr X in females were significantly distorted from Mendelian expectations.
Epigenetic predictors can be used to assess the relationship between the gene and lifespan: Yes, the context states that the study used three newly generated epigenetic predictors to test how they differ between genetically diverse mice from the BXD family.
Differential methylation analysis can be used to assess the relationship between the gene and lifespan: Yes, the context states that multivariable EWAS Site-by-Site differential methylation analysis (EWAS) was performed on the 27,966 CpGs using a multivariable regression model.
The gene's influence on specific late-life diseases and its effect on the risk of these diseases should be evaluated: Yes, the context states that the available dataset also provides examples in which genetic variants seem to influence the risk of specific late-life diseases.
