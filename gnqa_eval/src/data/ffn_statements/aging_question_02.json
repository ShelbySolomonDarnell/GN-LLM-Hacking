    "question": "Why is it so difficult to map gene loci that control aging in humans?",
    "statements": [
        "Mapping gene loci that control aging in humans is difficult due to several reasons.",
        "Aging is a complex phenotype influenced by multiple genes and their interactions with each other and the environment.",
        "The effects of common genetic variations on longevity are small, requiring large studies for identification.",
        "Human studies often face issues such as environmental heterogeneity, genetic diversity, and lack of birth-matched controls.",
        "The influence of social, economic, and cultural factors, which are unique to humans, can't be replicated in traditional model organisms, adding to the complexity.",
        "Traditional model organisms cannot fully capture the complexity of human aging due to the unique influence of social, economic, and cultural factors.",
        "The small effects of common genetic variations on longevity require large studies for identification, making it challenging to map gene loci that control aging in humans.",
        "The complexity of aging as a phenotype, influenced by multiple genes and environmental factors, contributes to the difficulty in mapping gene loci that control aging in humans.",
        "Human studies of aging are particularly challenging due to issues such as environmental heterogeneity, genetic diversity, and lack of birth-matched controls.",
        "The multifactorial nature of aging, including genetic and environmental factors, makes it difficult to identify the specific gene loci that control aging in humans."
