Social investigating behaviour of intact mGluR7 KO mice also differed from that of wild-type mice; e.g. the KO mice showing less frequent anogenital sniffing and more frequent grooming behaviour. Further, castrated mGluR7 KO mice have smaller seminal vesicles than those of castrated wild-type mice, although intact mice were no different.",
