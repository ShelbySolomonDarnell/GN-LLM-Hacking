    "1. A study assessing the impact of a rapamycin derivative on healthy aging in people (Mannick et al. 2014). 2. A veterinary clinical trial testing rapamycin as a treatment for osteosarcoma (Paoloni et al. 2010). 3. A veterinary clinical trial assessing the side effect profile and effects on age-associated cardiac function following 10 weeks of rapamycin treatment in healthy elderly dogs (Kaeberlein 2015). 4. A study on the pharmacokinetic analysis of rapamycin treatment in healthy dogs (Larson et al. 2016). 5. A study on the effects of rapamycin in aging mice (Johnson et al. 2015). 6. A study on the effects of rapamycin in rodents (Johnson et al. 2013). 7. A study on the effects of rapamycin on the replicative life of yeast (Reference [57]). 8. A study on the effects of rapamycin in 20-month-old mice (Reference [58]). 9. A study on the combination of rapamycin with other compounds for anti-aging activity (Reference [59]).",
    "Mapping gene loci that control aging in humans is difficult due to several reasons. Firstly, aging is a complex phenotype influenced by multiple genes and their interactions with each other and the environment. Secondly, the effects of common genetic variations on longevity are small, requiring large studies for identification. Thirdly, human studies often face issues such as environmental heterogeneity, genetic diversity, and lack of birth matched controls. Lastly, the influence of social, economic, and cultural factors, which are unique to humans, can't be replicated in traditional model organisms, adding to the complexity.",
    "One would evaluate a candidate gene for mouse lifespan by conducting gene mapping methods and using mouse life span as a surrogate for aging. This involves studying the genetic contributions to mortality rates, conducting sex-specific analyses, and determining any changes in pathology associated with the loci. The study would involve a large population of mice, and the results would be compared to Mendelian expectations. Additionally, epigenetic predictors and differential methylation analysis could be used to assess the relationship between the gene and lifespan. The gene's influence on specific late-life diseases and its effect on the risk of these diseases would also be evaluated.",
    "Yes, significant quantitative trait loci (QTLs) have been found in aging studies. Three examples include:  1. Lfdr1: This QTL was found on chromosome 7 and affects lifespan and fertility in response to dietary restriction. It also has suggestive effects on fuel efficiency (FE).  2. Fedr1 and Fedr2: These QTLs were identified on chromosomes 9 and 15 respectively. They have significant effects on fuel efficiency in response to dietary restriction.  3. QTLs associated with age-related thymic involution: These were identified in a study using C57BL/6 J X DBA/2 J (BXD) recombinant inbred (RI) strains of mice.",
    "The most fundamental human life expectancy extending geroscience studies include genetic and genomic research into longevity. These studies use both hypothesis-driven candidate gene approaches and explorative genome-wide analyses. They also involve the study of biomarkers related to aging, deep phenotyping, and the use of novel technologies like next-generation sequencing. Additionally, they examine the role of environmental factors, lifestyle, and heritability in human lifespan variation."

      "Rapamycin has been shown to be well tolerated in dogs, improves outcome in a glycogen storage disease model (Yi et al. 2014), and is currently being tested in veterinary clinical trials as a treatment for osteosarcoma (Paoloni et al. 2010).A veterinary clinical trial is underway to assess the side effect profile and effects on age-associated cardiac function following 10 weeks of rapamycin treatment in healthy elderly dogs (Kaeberlein 2015).",
      "Rapamycin is used clinically to prevent organ transplant rejection, for some forms of cancer, and to prevent restenosis in cardiac stents (Kaeberlein 2013b).Shortterm treatment with the rapamycin derivative RAD001 improves ageassociated decline in immune function, as measured by antibody response to an influenza vaccine, in healthy elderly people (Mannick et al. 2014).",
      "To date, only one study has been performed assessing the impact of a rapamycin derivative on healthy aging in people.In this trial, it was observed that 6 weeks of treatment with the rapamycin derivative RAD001 (everolimus) was sufficient to enhance function of the aged immune system, as assessed by response to an influenza vaccine (Mannick et al. 2014).This recapitulates what was observed in elderly mice (Chen et al. 2009), and suggests that at least some of the mechanisms by which rapamycin delays aging in mice work similarly in humans.Although both compounds have essentially identical biological activities, RAD001 was used in this study instead of rapamycin because the study was funded by Novartis, who holds the patent rights for RAD001 (rapamycin is now off patent and sold as a generic drug).The doses of RAD001 used in the human immune aging study were lower than those typically used to prevent organ transplant rejection and showed improved side effect profiles, although some adverse effects, including the presence of mouth sores in a subset of the patients, were noted.",
      "This trial is designed to determine whether treatment with the drug rapamycin (see Table 1) can significantly reduce age-related disease and disability as well as mortality in middle-aged large dogs.The initial phase of this trial, which is in progress at the time of this writing, is intended to enroll at least 32 dogs 6 years of age or older and 40 lb in weight or greater.Each animal receives an initial veterinary exam and comprehensive blood work along with a cardiac exam including echocardiography (Fig. 3).Those dogs that do not present with any abnormalities or significant pre-existing health conditions are randomized into either placebo or rapamycin treatment groups for a 10-week treatment period.Initial rapamycin dosing regimens were determined, in part, based on pharmacokinetic analysis of rapamycin treatment in healthy dogs (Larson et al. 2016).After 10 weeks in the study, each dog receives another full exam and blood chemistry panel as well as repeat cardiac exam.The primary goals of this first phase are to establish appropriate dosing of rapamycin in the absence of significant adverse events and to determine whether similar improvements in cardiac function are achieved in aged dogs after 10 weeks of rapamycin treatment, as has been observed in laboratory mice (Dai et al. 2014;Flynn et al. 2013).",
      "Fig. 3 Design of the current short-term rapamycin intervention trial.Dogs must weigh at least 40 pounds and be at least 6 years old at time of entry into the study.If no significant pre-existing health conditions are detected at the first exam, dogs are randomized into either placebo or one of the rapamycin treatment groups.Red indicates the 10-week period during which the dogs receive either rapamycin or placebo.Dogs receive the same generic rapamycin (sirolimus) pill that is provided to human patients.Asterisk Serum and feces are collected at each appointment for future metabolomic and microbiome analyses and for quantitation of circulating rapamycin levels",
      "Pending the outcome of phase 1, we anticipate enrolling several hundred additional dogs with similar entry criteria into a longer-term, 3-5 year study, to carefully assess the extent to which rapamycin improves health and reduces mortality in middle-age companion dogs.In addition to cardiac function, assessments of multiple age-related phenotypes will be performed including measures of cognitive function, muscle function, kidney function, glucose homeostasis, and cancer incidence.Many of these parameters are beneficially impacted by rapamycin in aging mice (Johnson et al. 2015), and we predict that rapamycin will induce similar improvements in aging dogs.",
      "Rapamycin is currently the most effective pharmacological intervention for extending lifespan and delaying a broad range of age-related functional declines in rodents (Johnson et al. 2013).However, the doses used clinically to prevent organ transplant rejection are associated with side effects, such as impaired wound healing, edema, elevated circulating triglycerides, impaired glucose homeostasis, gastrointestinal discomfort, and mouth ulcers (Augustine et al. 2007;de Oliveira et al. 2011).These adverse side effects would likely preclude long-term use of rapamycin at these levels in otherwise healthy people.With the possible exception of impaired glucose homeostasis (Lamming et al. 2012), these side effects have not been observed at doses that are associated with increased lifespan and healthspan in mice, however, raising the possibility that lower doses of this drug could promote healthy aging with minimal adverse effects.",
      "Rapamycin  Rapamycin is a macrolide isolated from Streptomyces hygroscopicus, a bacteria from Pascua Island (Rapa Nui).It has functions as an antibiotic, an immune suppressant drug, and it is also proposed as a CRM.After the first studies, it was found that rapamycin could induce the extension of the replicative life of yeast through the inhibition of TOR signaling [57].This compound could extend the lifetime useful in 20-month-old mice in correlation with TOR activity [58].These studies were the basis of the research to determine the function of rapamycin as a CRM, due to its modulating properties over proteostasis.In addition, studies suggest that rapamycin can be combined with other compounds (metformin, losartan, statins, propranolol, and aspirin among others) to potentiate their anti-aging activity [59].",

      "Rapamycin has serious side effects, particularly as an immunosuppressor, and thus it is not suitable as an antiaging drug.As in sirtuins, however, these studies highlight the road from basic discovery on the biology of aging to antiaging interventions.Further studies of the TOR pathway and of repressors more specific of its downstream signaling pathway are ongoing.Whether rapamycin produces a change in another parameter related to energy uptake or utilization is unknown, and determining which of its effects modulate lifespan is an important unsolved question.Like resveratrol, TOR has attracted considerable attention from the pharmaceutical industry, particularly in the context of cancer (Meric-Bernstam and Gonzalez-Angulo, 2009)."

      "FUTURE DIRECTIONS: HIGHER RESOLUTION DATA VIA HIGHER THROUGHPUT ASSAYS  One inescapable conclusion of the aggregate results of genome-wide studies of aging to date (see summary Table 1) is that we have not come close to saturating the number of potentially lifespan-altering genes in any organism.This is in no small part because directly generating survival curves is a relatively time-consuming process in most model organisms using current methods.There are several possible ways to address this.One way that has been tried is by attempting to find surrogate phenotypes [72,73,126] that can be screened more rapidly, or even scored under selection.Another is mining candidates from the many whole-genome expression profiles.Results to date with these have been very fruitful, but have not suggested that these methods alone will rapidly saturate our search for lifespan-and healthspan-altering genes in tractable model organisms.",
      "Genetic linkage studies of long-lived human families identified a longevity locus while candidate gene approaches have been used to identify and confirm the association between specific variants in the FOXO3A gene and human longevity [3\u20137]. Genome-wide association studies have also been used to identify the association of APOE with life  123 Aging Clin Exp Res  span and have yielded insights into potential biological pathways and processes related to aging. Despite these successes, several problems are inherent in human longevity studies including potentially high degrees of environmental heterogeneity, genetic diversity, and lack of birth matched controls, among others [8].",
      "Additional association studies with these families and replication of these results with an independent data set should facilitate the positional cloning of a gene that influences the ability to age well and achieve exceptional longevity.Identification of the genes in humans that allow certain individuals to live to extreme old age should lead to insights on cellular pathways that are important to the aging process.",
      "The aging process most certainly is under highly polygenic controls\u2026 This should not discourage us from pursuing a search for those loci which may be of profound importance to human aging as it ordinarily occurs in most human beings.",
      "In most experimentally modified animal model systems, single-gene mutations in many different genes have major life extension effects (Fontana et al., 2010;Kenyon, 2010).However, natural human and animal longevity is presumed to be a complex trait (Finch & Tanzi, 1997).In humans, both candidate gene and genome-wide genetic association approaches have been applied in an attempt to identify longevity loci.The frequency of genetic variants has been typically compared between nonagenarian cases and young controls, revealing loci at which genetic variants may contribute to a higher or lower probability of survival into old age.The initial candidate gene studies aimed at finding human longevity genes were dominated by contradictory results (Christensen et al., 2006).The more consistent evidence obtained by repeated observation in independent cohort studies for association with longevity has so far only been observed for three loci, the apolipoprotein E (APOE) locus (Schachter et al., 1994;Christensen et al., 2006), the FOXO3A locus (Willcox et al., 2008;Flachsbart et al., 2009;Pawlikowska et al., 2009;Soerensen et al., 2010), and the AKT1 locus (Pawlikowska et al., 2009).Thus, despite the expectation that longevity would be influenced by many genetic variants with small effect sizes, the effect of variants has consistently been shown in only three genes.",

Given the ambiguities and limitations of large-effect mutant studies of aging, discussed earlier, those publications do not provide very useful evidence with respect to the question of the number of loci that affect aging. At present, the best answer to the question of the number of genes controlling aging is many (Rose and Long 2002), in keeping with the original expectations of evolutionary biologists. However, studies of the genetics of the experimental evolution of aging are now amenable to the application of genomic methods.",
      "Accepted Article  \u00a9 2013 The Authors Aging Cell \u00a9 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/Anatomical Society of Great Britain and Ireland over 90 years and 1,955 controls between 55 and 80 years did not reveal genome-wide significant loci (Newman et al., 2010) and neither did the analyses of all-cause mortality and survival free of major disease in this cohort (Walter et al., 2011).A smaller Dutch study of 403 nonagenarians and 1,670 controls younger than 65 years identified the APOE gene as a mortality locus (Deelen et al., 2011), which was confirmed in a German study of 763 long-lived individuals and 1,085 younger controls (Nebel et al., 2011) and a longitudinal study of 1,606 Danes showed that the effect size of this association increases at the highest ages (Jacobsen et al., 2010).Apparently, the influence of the common genetic variation on longevity is small which requires large meta-GWA studies for identification.Alternatively, rare genetic variants may play a more important role in longevity.Since the previous linkage studies showed contradictory results potentially due to heterogeneity in the longevity phenotype, it is expected that longevity is influenced by many private rare variants.",
      "The lack of success in the identification of genes related to aging in humans may be due to the complexity of the phenotype.One approach to investigate aging and longevity is to compare frequencies of genetic variants between nonagenarians or centenarians and the general population.This approach led to the discovery of an association between APOE (Deelen et al., 2011;Ewbank, 2007;Gerdes et al., 2000) and more recently FOXO3A (Anselmi et al., 2009;Flachsbart et al., 2009;Li et al., 2009a;Pawlikowska et al., 2009;Willcox et al., 2008) and human aging and longevity.However, a recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) of individuals reaching the age of 90 or older failed to identify genome-wide significant variants (Newman et al., 2010).",
      "Several explanations are possible for the lack of genomewide significant findings.First, mortality is arguably 1 of the most complex phenotypes, and several trajectories toward extreme old age have been identified (Evert et al., 2003).Multiple genes could mediate the aging process but would have their effects through numerous different patho-physiological processes and diseases that act as intermediate factors on the pathway to death (de Magalhaes et al., 2010).Therefore, any common variation in genes associated with aging probably has a small effect.",
      "Second, the largely negative findings of this and other studies contrast with the intriguing animal studies of longevity.Very large effects of single genes on lifespan have indeed been observed in laboratory animals, but humans often have several homologues of these genes which might significantly differ in function or compensate for mutated genes through redundant mechanisms (Kuningas et al., 2008).This could explain why our top findings did not include genes in these pathways found in animal models.Animal models also represent genetically homogenous populations and are exposed to controlled environmental influences.The lack of replication of animal model findings in humans suggests that the use of knockout animals may not provide the optimal approach to understanding the variation in survival in humans as interactions with environmental factors may obscure the associations and prevent the identification of loci in humans.",

However, studies of the genetics of the experimental evolution of aging are now amenable to the application of genomic methods.",
      "The remarkable discoveries of the past 2 decades showing that single genes can regulate aging in model organisms demonstrate that aging can be genetically manipulated (Finch and Ruvkun, 2001;Kenyon, 2010).Hundreds of genes that modulate longevity have now been identified in model organisms (de Magalha \u02dces et al., 2009a).In some cases (e.g., in worms), mutations in single genes can extend lifespan by almost 10-fold (Ayyadevara et al., 2008).Nonetheless, aging is a complex process that derives not from single genes but from the interactions of multiple genes with each other and with the environment.Evidence from animal systems shows a major impact of the environment on aging, yet environmental manipulations of aging act through genes and proteins, usually by triggering signaling pathways and modulating gene expression.In fact, some genes have been shown in model organisms to have varying effects on lifespan depending on diet (Heikkinen et al., 2009).Genes that can regulate aging in model organisms cannot be directly applied to humans through genetic manipulations for numerous legal, ethical, and technical reasons.If we could understand how the environment modulates these aging-related genes, we might be able to create antiaging therapies applicable to humans, potentially through diet, lifestyle, and even pharmacological interventions.Therefore, understanding genome-environment interactions in the context of aging can be a powerful approach to identify attractive targets for drug design.",
      "Results from mutational analysis across eukaryote model organisms have shown unexpected conservation of genes and processes regulating aging.While unique properties exist within particular organisms that modulate these foundational networks, the conservation provides a tool to refine human genetic studies.As noted, GWAS for human longevity metrics suffer from large sample size requirements to obtain statistical resolution due to multiple hypothesis testing across the genome.Assuming that evolutionary genesets for longevity could be generated with confidence, an intersection of them with human variation data would increase the sensitivity of association studies.This would serve as a selective filter to refine the number of loci investigated for association in human populations.Similarly, such evolutionary filters could refine analysis of rare, unique variation within genome sequence data from extremely long-lived cohorts.A similar approach to refine human longevity GWAS used an intersection with age-related disease datasets.This 'disease-informed' GWAS helped refine candidates (iGWAS, Fortney et al., 2015), though, it should be noted that this particular strategy would further blur the distinction between aging and longevity as discussed above.The definition of gene sets from evolutionary experiments in longevity, across clades, would similarly empower detection of networks previously hidden under GWAS in human population analyses (Figure 3).",
      "ANALYSIS OF HUMAN VARIATION IN THE GENETIC CONTROL OF LONGEVITY  Heritability studies have convincingly demonstrated that at least some fraction of human lifespan is heritable.In tandem, large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous loci associated with age-related traits (Buniello et al., 2019).While genetic studies have functionally shown an inverse effect of multiple age-related, diseaseassociated variants on lifespan regulation, the number of well-replicated longevity-conferring variants remains limited to variants in APOE (ApoE \u03b52), and more recently, CDKN2A/B and IL6 (see Table 1).To date, studies in humans have been hampered by the specific phenotype definitions used, sample sizes of the extreme phenotypes, and modest heritability of the longevity-related traits (Breitbach et al., 2019).This is due to the complex interplay of biological and social factors involved in human aging, as well as the limited power of GWAS, which require sampling thousands of subjects to achieve statistical significance (Breitbach et al., 2019).Genetic studies of aging have also been hindered by an inconsistent use of definitions of aging (reviewed in Baghdadi et al., 2020).The two main ways of conducting research on the genetics of longevity in human populations are by studying (i) the lifespan (continuous trait, years lived) and (ii) the longevity (dichotomous trait, i.e., being among the longest-lived individuals within a specific population).These complexities have limited the resolution and capability of broad association studies of human longevity.Importantly, these genomic analyses focus on a shift of survival in a population; these variables may be genetically distinct from the mechanisms establishing potential for longevity overall (Figure 1A).We argue that an understanding of this shift in lifespan as well as genetic mechanisms of regulating a species specific 'set points' (Figure 1B) will aid in the conceptual distinction of aging and longevity in humans.",
      "TRANSLATION OF LONGEVITY MODEL ORGANISMS AND CORE AGING PATHWAYS  Genetic studies on lifespan have proven to be challenging.While longevity is a defining trait for a given species, the lifespan of individuals is of limited heritability, making analyses more difficult.Exceptional human life span, although a rare phenotype, is likely multifactorial; refined analyses are required to obtain statistically robust genomic signatures of longevity (Zhang et al., 2020) and these have proven elusive.Unlike laboratory models, the effect of environmental variance cannot be controlled in human studies, potentially masking purely biological aging mechanisms.Even laboratory models cannot replicate the complex \"environment\" of humans; it includes psychosocial, economic, and cultural factors, rather than strictly biological.These human-specific confounders are difficult or impossible to target in traditional model organisms.Despite these limitations, experimentally tractable model organisms have proven invaluable in deciphering the purely genetic contribution to lifespan, including genes and pathways conserved across the tree of life.",
      "Our analyses show that it is extremely unlikely that there is a single gene harboring rare protein-altering variants shared by all supercentenarians but no controls.It is not surprising that a highly complex trait such as longevity is not explained by a single Mendelian gene.",
      "With modern genomic technologies and largescale data analysis methods, it is possible to sift through the genes of populations to find the loci that act to postpone aging. [3]There are uncertainties with the comparison of populations with different rates of aging.However, it is superior to experimental designs that only consider age-dependence or dietary-response, without determining causal mechanisms.",
      "Although the models data set comprises all genes (to our knowledge) shown by the time of the latest update to statistically increase longevity or alter the aging process in a noticeable way, in the human data set we try to evaluate whether a given intervention is affecting the aging process itself or not.For example, many mutations may increase longevity by decreasing the incidence of specific diseases, rather than by altering the basic process of aging (de Magalh\u00e3es et al ., 2005a(de Magalh\u00e3es et al ., , 2005b)).Therefore, the human data set is not merely an extension of the work conducted in model organisms and of its bibliography, but a manually selected list of the most pertinent human aging candidate genes, each presented with a higher annotation level.We cite studies on whether the functions of aging-associated genes in model organisms are conserved in their human orthologues.Likewise, we cite flaws in previous studies based on new published observations, although we have a neutral stance on conflicting findings from different research groups.Our policy is to cite all conflicting reports and let visitors make their own decisions on how to interpret them.By contrast, each entry in GenAge model organisms has only one reference: the first publication reporting an association of the gene with longevity or aging.Moreover, one of the latest enhancements in the human data set was the inclusion of Gene Ontology annotation.Gene Ontology terms and annotation files were obtained from the Gene Ontology Consortium website (http://www.geneontology.org/ ) and provide an additional layer of description for the gene products in a cellular context (Ashburner et al ., 2000).",
      "Conclusions and prospects  Over the past two decades the human aging field has built up the necessary resources to study the biology of aging and longevity by establishing human populations with a diversity of designs.Meta-analyses integrating genetic and phenotypic datasets have successfully identified variants associated with a range of age-related traits and diseases.Despite these accomplishments, the number of novel leads contributing to human lifespan regulation is limited.Although positive regions of linkage and suggestive GWAS hits have been reported, the field has not yet identified the loci that explain the clustering of longevity in families and the variation in biological aging rate in the population.As for animal models, down-signaling of the IIS and mTOR pathway appeared to be relevant in humans.These findings are being followed up by molecular and physiological profiling using skin, fat and muscle tissue of long-lived family members and controls.Human studies now also include the response of nutrient sensing systems to the application of dietary and physical challenges.",
      "Most of the human candidate gene studies were performed in cross-sectional designs (Box 1 and Fig. 1), comparing allele frequencies of potential longevity loci between highly aged individuals and young controls.The candidate gene studies based on single genes have pointed a role for genes involved in, e.g., GH/insulin/IGF-1 signaling, immune regulation, and lipoprotein metabolism (Supporting Information Table S1), although most of these results have not (yet) been confirmed in sufficient independent studies.The most convincing human longevity loci today are APOE and FOXO3A which have frequently been associated with longevity in cross-sectional studies (see for a review [26]) and survival in prospective studies [27][28][29] (Fig. 3).APOE encodes the protein apolipoprotein E which seems to play a role in e.g., lipoprotein metabolism, cognitive function, and immune regulation [30].FOXO3A encodes the protein forkhead box O3 which acts as a transcription factor for many different genes involved in processes like apoptosis and oxidative stress [31]."

      "Our own work has taken a different tack: we have attempted to determine whether mutations with differential effects on aging may be present within the many available populations of laboratory-adopted inbred mice.The goal is not so much to clone these genes-if indeed they existbecause positional cloning strategies of this kind require many thousands of animals and would be extremely expensive using an assay, age at death, that is itself so costly.Instead, the goal has been to use gene mapping methods to test hypotheses about aging and to develop new animal models that will be useful for testing well-specified hypotheses about the molecular basis for age-dependent changes.In the absence of a validated battery of biomarkers of aging, we (like most others) have reluctantly decided to use mouse life span as a crude surrogate for aging itself, reasoning that genetic alleles that extend life span well beyond the median for the tested population may be operating via an influence on aging itself.Work conducted using recombinant inbred mouse stocks (Gelman et al., 1988;de Haan and Van Zant, 1999) has suggested that life-span differences between pairs of inbred mouse lines might reflect the influence of as few as 4-7 polymorphic loci, providing some basis for hope that some of these would have an effect large enough to be detected by a genome scan experiment involving 300-1,200 mice.",
      "The available dataset also provides examples in which genetic variants seem to influence the risk of specific late-life diseases.Figure 8-6, for example, shows longevity results for mice stratified by their inheritance at the 12th chromosome locus D12Mit167.This is a locus associated with differential longevity in both male and female mice, with the strongest effect (adjusted p < 0.01) seen in those mice living more than 657 days (Jackson et al., unpublished results).The longest-lived mice are those that inherit both the C57BL/6 allele from their mother and the C3H allele from their father; on average, they survive 93 days longer than siblings with the BALB plus C3H combination.Figure 8-6 shows that the D12Mit167, like the pair of loci illustrated in Figure 8-5, has significant and similar effects in mice dying of cancer (85 days) and in mice dying of non-neoplastic diseases (126 days).A more detailed analysis of the cancers, however, suggests that while lymphoma and hepatoma victims are equally protected by the favorable alleles (effect sizes of 93 and 167 days, respec-  mice of two subgroups: those dying of the urinary syndrome MUS, and those dying of all other causes.The genetic analysis contrasts mice with both the C57BL/6 allele at D4Mit84 and the C3H allele at D9Mit110 to mice with any of the three other allele combinations.In the males dying of causes other than MUS, this allele pair is associated with a 170-day increment in longevity (post-hoc p < 0.00003).But for males that do die of MUS, the same allele combination is associated with a 187-day decline in mean life span (post-hoc p < 0.03).This effect is thus pleiotropic, in that these alleles accelerate death in mice susceptible to MUS, while postponing death for all other males in the population.Although these loci are associated with differential longevity in mice that do develop MUS, they do not have a significant effect on the chances that MUS will indeed occur (not shown).The risk of developing MUS seems to be under control of a separate locus on chromosome 6.As shown in the bottom panel of Figure 8-7, males that inherit the C3H allele at D6Mit268 are far more likely to develop MUS (28 percent risk) than are their brothers who receive the DBA/2 allele at this locus (7 percent risk; p = 0.012 by two-tailed Fisher's exact test).",
      "Previously, the methylation status of CpG sites within the genes Prima1, Hsf4, Kcns1 was shown to qualify as a reliable predictor of chronological age of B6 mice.10 This same study also revealed enhanced epigenetic aging of the D2 strain in accordance with its general reduced mean life span, supporting the possibility that the panel might also serve as a marker for the biological age in mice. Applying this B6trained marker panel to our (congenic) experimental strains, we observed that epigenetic age predictions correlated with chronological age in B6 (R2=0.93) and line A mice (R2=0.89).",

      "coid levels, etc.The mapping project should thus help to guide the search for human genes that regulate these interesting phenotypes and at the same time spark new investigations, in animal models, for the biochemical differences that mediate the genetic effects we detect.At the same time, the dataset that emerges should also allow us to test more general questions about the nature of aging and its genetic control.We may, for example, be able to identify QTLs that not only retard the development of one or more age-sensitive T-cell subsets, but also retard age-dependent changes in protein conformation, bone matrix turnover, and brain GFAP levels.Such a finding would imply that these changes are influenced, together, by a common biochemical pathway, and the corresponding QTLs would be excellent candidates for genes that regulate aging per se, rather than merely one among the many more agesensitive traits.In the same way, it will be of particular interest to determine if QTLs that regulate age-sensitive traits also are associated with differences in life span, and conversely if QTLs identified on the basis of longevity effects modify one (or nearly all?) of the age-sensitive traits in our test battery.",
      "The strategy for mapping such quantitative trait loci (QTL) involves looking for preferential segregation of specific alleles or allele combina-tions in mice that differ in life span (or, more generally, any age-sensitive trait of interest).Our test population, called UM-HET3, consisted of a group of mice bred as the progeny of females of the (BALB/c \u00d7 C57BL/6)F1 genotype and males of the (C3H/HeJ \u00d7 DBA/2)F1 genotype.Mice bred in this way are, from a genetic perspective, all siblings; each shares a random half of its alleles with every other animal in the UM-HET3 population.The current set of analyses was conducted when genotype and longevity data were available from a group of 110 virgin males and 143 virgin females.The analytical method adjusted, by permutation testing, for Type I errors attributable to the simultaneous evaluation of multiple linkage hypotheses, and also included gender as a covariate to look for instances of sex-specific genetic effects.Because we had particular interest in regulation of late-life diseases rather than in causes of premature death, and because of evidence that genetic influences on mouse longevity were particularly strong when early deaths were not considered (Covelli et al., 1989), we repeated each analysis after exclusion of those animals dying before 657 days of age, i.e., the age at which 20 percent of the animals had already died.",
      "The proportion of the phenotypic variance accounted for by the QTL yield for Hbact and Hbrear was substantial and of the same order of magnitude as that contributed by age. A small number of age-dependent QTL were found in the midst of a majority of age-stable QTL (see discussion above). These age-sensitive loci point toward genes whose functions are correlated with important behavioral changes during aging.",
      "Ageing genes and pathways.Assessing the loci of interest for colocalisation with gene expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), we find strong evidence (FDR SMR < 5%; P HEIDI > 1%; see \"Methods\") of cis-acting eQTL colocalisation for eight out of 10 loci.In total, we highlight 27 unique genes acting across 32 tissues, especially whole blood (12 genes) and the tibial nerve (7 genes) (Supplementary Data 5).In blood, higher expression levels of BCL3 and CKM (near APOE); CTC-510F12.2, ILF3, KANK2 and PDE4A (near LDLR); USP28 and ANKK1 (near ZW10); and CDKN2B are linked to an increase in multivariate ageing traits (i.e.improved survival), while the opposite is true for EXOC3L2 (near APOE), TTC12 (near ZW10), and FOXO3.For the multivariate signal near SLC4A7 we find colocalisation with expression of NEK10 (liver); for the signal near LPA we find colocalisation with expression of SLC22A1/A3 (multiple tissues) and MAP3K4 (pituitary); and for the signal near FGD6 we find colocalisation with expression of FGD6 itself (adipose/arterial).Including trans-acting eQTL from blood, while keeping the same thresholds for colocalisation, we additionally discover higher expression levels of FOXO3B colocalises with the life-extending signal near FOXO3.When we include genes which could not be tested for heterogeneity (N eQTL < 3), we identify one additional cis-acting and 49 additional trans-acting genes (of which 10 colocalise with the signal near LINC02513) (Table 2; Supplementary Data 5).",

      "In order to find the causal loci for heritable differences in transcript levels and possible interactions between age and genotype, we applied a two-time-point model.In this model, we used three factors-(1) relative age, (2) genotype (marker), and (3) the interaction between factors 1 and 2-to explain the differences in gene expression between RILs and age groups.With this mapping procedure, we found almost 900 genes that had an eQTL or gxa eQTL in developing and/or aging worms (P < 0.0001; Fig. 2).Almost half of these genes with heritable transcript differences were found to have a genotype-by-age effect (396 at P < 0.0001; Table 1) allocated to a specific marker, which we coined genotype-by-age expression-QTL ( gxa eQTL).One specific hotspot (trans-band) for gxa eQTL was found on chromosome IV for aging worms and a trans-band for eQTL on chromosome I was detected in developing worms (Fig. 2).",

      "Currently prevailing studies of genetic and biological origin of human health and longevity follow largely two approaches which focus on the aging-related diseases and on individuals with exceptionally long lives (Martin et al. 2007).This study provides de facto the rationale for a new approach.Specifically, Fig. 2 suggests that a promising strategy could be to focus on individuals who died prematurely.Studies of genetic profiles of short-lived subjects compared to those who aged more successfully (i.e., those who lived longer and perhaps healthier lives) can be a core of this strategy.Importantly, this strategy can be naturally implemented in longitudinal studies of aging and longevity by focusing on individuals who died first.",
      "T he average human life expectancy has been increasing for centuries 1 .Based on twin studies, the heritability of human lifespan has been estimated to be ~25%, although this estimate differs among studies 2 .On the other hand, the heritability of lifespan based on the correlation of the mid-parent (i.e., the average of the father and mother) and offspring difference between age at death and expected lifespan was estimated to be 12% 3 .A recent study has indicated that the different heritability estimates may be inflated due to assortative mating, leaving a true heritability that is below 10% 4 .The heritability of lifespan, estimated using the sibling relative risk, increases with age 5 and is assumed to be enriched in long-lived families, particularly when belonging to the 10% longest-lived of their generation 6 .To identify genetic associations with human lifespan, several genome-wide association (GWA) studies have been performed [7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20] .These studies have used a discrete (i.e., older cases versus younger controls) or a continuous phenotype (such as age at death of individuals or their parents).The selection of cases for the studies using a discrete longevity phenotype has been based on the survival to ages above 90 or 100 years or belonging to the top 10% or 1% of survivors in a population.Studies defining cases using a discrete longevity phenotype often need to rely on controls from more contemporary birth cohorts, because all others from the case birth cohorts have died before sample collection.Previous GWA studies have identified several genetic variants, but the only locus that has shown genome-wide significance (P \u2264 5 \u00d7 10 \u22128 ) in multiple independent meta-analyses of GWA studies is apolipoprotein E (APOE) 21 , where the ApoE \u03b54 variant is associated with lower odds of being a long-lived case.",
      "Introduction  Worldwide human populations have shown an increase in mean life expectancy in the past two centuries (Oeppen & Vaupel, 2002).This is mainly because of environmental factors such as improved hygiene, nutrition, and health care.The large variation in healthy lifespan among the elderly has prompted research into the determinants of aging and lifespan regulation.The genetic contribution to human lifespan variation was estimated at 25-30% in twin studies (Gudmundsson et al., 2000;Skytthe et al., 2003;Hjelmborg et al., 2006).The most prominent genetic influence is observed in families in which the capacity to attain a long lifespan clusters (Perls et al., 2000;Schoenmaker et al., 2006).Exceptional longevity can be reached with a low degree of age-related disability (Christensen et al., 2008;Terry et al., 2008), raising the question whether protective mechanisms against disease exist in long-lived subjects.",
      "Introduction  Human life expectancies are increasing almost everywhere in the world where socio-economic circumstances are permissive (Tuljapurkar et al., 2000) and there is no evidence that a limit to life is anywhere near (Oeppen and Vaupel, 2002).While this increase in life span would prevent a proposed compression of morbidity (Fries, 1980), there is no evidence that higher average life spans are associated with an extension of the period of increased morbidity (Manton and Gu, 2001).On the contrary, older individuals have never been so healthy and further improvements in life style, environmental conditions and medical care are likely to help this trend to continue.Especially the medical sciences now seem poised to push the biological limits of longevity further by a number of innovations that seem to affect basic mechanisms of ageing and disease rather than merely alleviating its symptoms.While in the past medicine contributed mainly to public health advances by redu-cing infectious diseases, thereby helping infant mortality to decline, more recent developments hold promise for a more basic intervention in the processes that underlie age-related decline.An example is atherosclerosis, a common problem in ageing and, along with hypertension, the cause of most cardiovascular disease.Basic medical research has likely contributed significantly to the current dramatic decline in cardiovascular disease by actively intervening in some of its main risk factors, i.e., lipid levels and hypertension (Levi et al., 2002).However, one could question whether age-related diseases should be seen as separate from ageing.In this respect, ageing has been considered as a process of cellular degeneration and death universal to all or most species, increasing the risk of fatal disease in humans and other mammals.Would it be possible to define such a process and ultimately understand it in terms of the timedependent, coordinated action of the products of multiple genes interacting with the environment?If so, then ageing per se rather than the diseases associated with it, may offer a more logical starting point for further increasing healthy life expectancies through prevention and therapy.This is especially true now that we have a working draft of the human genome and are in a position to determine the functional significance of each gene as part of the dynamic network of all genes that ultimately determine the physiology of an organism.Termed 'Functional Genomics', this new discipline is now often called upon to solve the complex problems in biology, such as to understand functional control mechanisms and investigate the role that genotype and environment play in determining disease phenotypes.The question is then if this same approach would apply to ageing as a complex phenotype.What is ageing, how does it differ from its diametrical opposite, i.e., organismal development, and what role can functional genomics play in unraveling the basic causes of ageing and exploit such knowledge for developing new, rational strategies for extending healthy life span?",
      "Introduction  As a result of improvements in health care and living conditions over the past two centuries, the average human life expectancy has dramatically increased in many regions of the world [1].This major success reflects the great malleability of the ageing process.Unfortunately, for most people, ageing is accompanied with an increased risk of developing age-related illnesses/disabilities and frailty.Therefore new approaches are required to understand the genetic, cellular, and molecular factors controlling ageing to identify strategies to extend healthy life span.",
      "The search for the genetic determinants of extreme human longevity has been challenged by the phenotype's rarity and its nonspecific definition by investigators.To address these issues, we established a consortium of four studies of extreme longevity that contributed 2,070 individuals who survived to the oldest one percentile of survival for the 1900 U.S. birth year cohort.We conducted various analyses to discover longevity-associated variants (LAV) and characterized those LAVs that differentiate survival to extreme age at death (eSAVs) from those LAVs that become more frequent in centenarians because of mortality selection (eg, survival to younger years).The analyses identified new rare variants in chromosomes 4 and 7 associated with extreme survival and with reduced risk for cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer's disease.The results confirm the importance of studying truly rare survival to discover those combinations of common and rare variants associated with extreme longevity and longer health span.",

      "Introduction  The recent, remarkable extension of life expectancy is largely attributed to the postponement of mortality at old age (Vaupel, 1997(Vaupel, , 2010)).The years of life gained in the older population residing in developed nations are a success story of public health measures and improved health care.In addition to such external factors, longevity and healthy aging consistently show a modest heritability between 20% and 50% and aging-associated genetic research may provide further insights into the mechanisms of aging (Herskind et al., 1996;McGue et al., 1993;Reed and Dick, 2003).It has been postulated that genes involved in pathways associated with aging identified in animal models, such as insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-insulin signaling, regulation of lipoprotein metabolism, the mTOR pathway, and the oxidative stress response may also influence survival to old or even exceptionally old age in humans (Christensen et al., 2006;Kenyon, 2010;Vellai et al., 2003).However, in humans, common variants within genes involved in these pathways have not been consistently associated with lifespan (Chris-tensen et al., 2006;Kenyon, 2010;Kuningas et al., 2008;Vijg and Suh, 2005).",
      "DESIGNS TO STUDY PARAMETERS OF HEALTHY AGEING, MORBIDITY, MORTALITY AND LONGEVITY  Human cohorts may vary considerably in their morbidity, mortality and longevity characteristics and yet they have shown a common increase in mean life expectancy in the past two centuries [5].This is mainly due to improved hygiene, nutrition and healthcare.There is a large variation in healthy lifespan among the elderly and remarkably exceptional longevity (EL) can be reached with a low degree of agerelated disability [6,7].Heritability studies comparing the concordance of lifespan in monozygous and dizygous twins estimated a 25 -30% genetic contribution to human lifespan variation [8 -11], which becomes increasingly important at higher ages.The most prominent genetic influence is present in families in which survival to high ages clusters [12,13].Unlike model systems where single-gene mutations have major life extension effects, human longevity is presumed to be a complex trait [14].",
      "INTRODUCTION  Genomic studies into human longevity are inspired by the fact that, in animal models, healthy lifespan has proved to be remarkably plastic, and major pathways of lifespan regulation have been identified.Considerable lifespan extension has been induced in models as diverse as yeast, worms, fish, flies and rodents by applying genetic manipulation and dietary restriction (DR) (see [1] for review).Reduced activity of nutrient-sensing pathways such as insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) signalling (IIS) and target of rapamycin (TOR) signalling mediated lifespan extension, and also the extension of lifespan by DR [2].An interesting observation from the perspective of human ageing is that, in rodents and monkeys, diets restricted in glucose, fat or protein uptake reduced or delayed the risk of cancer and metabolic disease, thus extending the healthspan of the animals [2].Following the discovery of genes and pathways involved in animal lifespan extension, human research has focused on the corresponding candidate human genes with genetic, genomic and epigenetic studies into ageing and longevity.The designs of these studies differ with respect to the selection of naturally occurring phenotypes and the study populations, which include population-based, patient-based, family-based and exposure-based cohorts.",
      "GENETIC STUDIES OF HUMAN LONGEVITY  Genetic and genomic studies into longevity have been performed based on a hypothesis, referred to as a candidate gene approach.Alternatively, explorative genome-wide analyses have been applied in which genetic variation and gene transcription across the complete genome are being studied for associations with longevity and related traits.Genetic studies into human disease and longevity include candidate gene approaches, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and genome-wide linkage studies.",
      "ANALYSIS OF HUMAN VARIATION IN THE GENETIC CONTROL OF LONGEVITY  Heritability studies have convincingly demonstrated that at least some fraction of human lifespan is heritable.In tandem, large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous loci associated with age-related traits (Buniello et al., 2019).While genetic studies have functionally shown an inverse effect of multiple age-related, diseaseassociated variants on lifespan regulation, the number of well-replicated longevity-conferring variants remains limited to variants in APOE (ApoE \u03b52), and more recently, CDKN2A/B and IL6 (see Table 1).To date, studies in humans have been hampered by the specific phenotype definitions used, sample sizes of the extreme phenotypes, and modest heritability of the longevity-related traits (Breitbach et al., 2019).This is due to the complex interplay of biological and social factors involved in human aging, as well as the limited power of GWAS, which require sampling thousands of subjects to achieve statistical significance (Breitbach et al., 2019).Genetic studies of aging have also been hindered by an inconsistent use of definitions of aging (reviewed in Baghdadi et al., 2020).The two main ways of conducting research on the genetics of longevity in human populations are by studying (i) the lifespan (continuous trait, years lived) and (ii) the longevity (dichotomous trait, i.e., being among the longest-lived individuals within a specific population).These complexities have limited the resolution and capability of broad association studies of human longevity.Importantly, these genomic analyses focus on a shift of survival in a population; these variables may be genetically distinct from the mechanisms establishing potential for longevity overall (Figure 1A).We argue that an understanding of this shift in lifespan as well as genetic mechanisms of regulating a species specific 'set points' (Figure 1B) will aid in the conceptual distinction of aging and longevity in humans.",
      "Introduction  Human longevity is influenced by multiple genetic and environmental factors.Approximately 25-32% of the overall variation in adult lifespan is because of genetic variation that becomes particularly important for survival at advanced age (Hjelmborg et al., 2006).Epidemiological studies have revealed that long-lived individuals (LLI), that is, people surviving to the 95th percentile of the respective birth cohort-specific age distributions (Gudmundsson et al., 2000), frequently show a favorable ('healthy') course of the aging process, with the absence or a delayed onset of agerelated diseases (Hitt et al., 1999).Hence, the LLI offer the key to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the 'healthy aging' phenotype (Perls, 2006).",
      "Conclusions and prospects  Over the past two decades the human aging field has built up the necessary resources to study the biology of aging and longevity by establishing human populations with a diversity of designs.Meta-analyses integrating genetic and phenotypic datasets have successfully identified variants associated with a range of age-related traits and diseases.Despite these accomplishments, the number of novel leads contributing to human lifespan regulation is limited.Although positive regions of linkage and suggestive GWAS hits have been reported, the field has not yet identified the loci that explain the clustering of longevity in families and the variation in biological aging rate in the population.As for animal models, down-signaling of the IIS and mTOR pathway appeared to be relevant in humans.These findings are being followed up by molecular and physiological profiling using skin, fat and muscle tissue of long-lived family members and controls.Human studies now also include the response of nutrient sensing systems to the application of dietary and physical challenges.",
      "Human lifespan variation is mainly determined by environmental factors, whereas the genetic contribution is 25-30% and expected to be polygenic.Two complementary fields go hand in hand in order to unravel the mechanisms of biological aging: genomic and biomarker research.Explorative and candidate gene studies of the human genome by genetic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic approaches have resulted in the identification of a limited number of interesting positive linkage regions, genes, and pathways that contribute to lifespan variation.The possibilities to further exploit these findings are rapidly increasing through the use of novel technologies, such as next-generation sequencing.Genomic research is progressively being integrated with biomarker studies on aging, including the application of (noninvasive) deep phenotyping and omics data -generated using novel technologies -in a wealth of studies in human populations.Hence, these studies may assist in obtaining a more holistic perspective on the role of the genome in aging and lifespan regulation."
