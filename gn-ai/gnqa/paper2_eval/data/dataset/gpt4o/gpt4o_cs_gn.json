    "A gene network is a graphical model comprised of nodes and edges, where the nodes typically represent genes, gene products, or other biological entities [1]. These networks illustrate how genes do not function in isolation but operate in complex networks that define the behavior of biological systems [2]. Understanding gene networks is crucial for interpreting the roles of individual genes within the broader context of these networks, which can provide insights into complex system behaviors, including diseases [1], [2]. By considering genes within their networks, researchers can better understand the interrelationships and regulatory mechanisms that contribute to phenotypic traits and disease processes [4].",
    "Researchers identify important genes for certain traits using GeneNetwork.org through a series of steps and tools provided by the platform:  1. **Data Selection and Trait Mining**: Researchers begin by selecting a data set and mining it for traits of interest based on user search queries [1]. This involves using the main search page to query specific data sets and identify traits that are relevant to their study.  2. **Trait Collection and Analysis**: Once traits are identified, they are selected and placed in a collection for further inspection and quantitative analysis [1].

    "The difference between looking at one gene and studying a whole gene network lies in the scope and context of the analysis. When examining a single gene, the focus is on understanding the role and function of that specific gene, often in isolation. This approach can be limited because it does not consider the interactions and relationships that gene may have with others.  In contrast, studying a whole gene network involves analyzing a system of interconnected genes, which provides a broader context. A gene network is a graphical model where nodes represent genes or gene products, and edges represent interactions between them [1]. This approach allows researchers to explore how multiple genes interact within biological pathways, potentially uncovering complex relationships and combined effects that a single-gene analysis might miss [2]. By studying gene networks, researchers can gain insights into the collective behavior of genes, which can be crucial for understanding complex diseases and biological functions [2]. Additionally, gene networks can help identify highly connected subgraphs that correspond to biologically relevant networks, aiding in the identification of causative genes and their regulatory roles [5]."

Constructing gene networks can provide a convenient framework for exploring the context within which single genes operate. A network is simply a graphicalmodel comprised of nodes and edges.

Studying complex diseasesin terms of gene networks rather thanindividual genes or genomic loci shouldaid in uncovering disease genes. Withthis approach, the effects of multiplegenes in the network are combined,producing a stronger signal and reducingthe number of statistical tests of associ-ation that must be performed.",

It should also be noted that our approach is different from studying gene-gene regulation within a pathway, which focuses on the interactive activities of individual gene pairs genes within a pathway.

To begin, a large genecorrelation graph must be sifted through, to find a highlyconnected subgraph that corresponds biologically to a genenetwork in which genes are expressed together, presumablyto regulate or subserve a common function. They must thenfind a small set of causative genes, highly correlated withthe subgraph and likely to regulate coexpression, to be usedas targets of focused investigation. By manipulating the",

Such coexpressed  modules can then be studied as putative functional units, thereby considerably  reducing the dimensionality of the data.
