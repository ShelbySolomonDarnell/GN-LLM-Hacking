It has been demonstrated that the microbiota on this population maintains  the health and promotes the survival. Additionally, a relationship between a healthy  microbiota and longevity had been proposed [44]. A possible pathway is an immu- nological and metabolic regulation linked to the increase of bacterial compounds  like Christensenellaceae, Akkermansia, and Bifidobacterium [44, 45].",

  "answer": "Changes in the gut microbiome composition are closely linked to aging and longevity. As individuals age, the composition and function of the gut microbiome undergo significant modifications. These changes are thought to contribute to various age-related processes, including immunosenescence and inflammaging, which are associated with the aging immune system [6].   Research has shown that a healthy microbiota can promote survival and is linked to longevity. Specifically, certain bacterial families such as Christensenellaceae, Akkermansia, and Bifidobacterium have been associated with immunological and metabolic regulation, which may contribute to increased lifespan [1].   Additionally, the gut microbiota of older adults differs in type and number of microorganisms compared to younger adults, with Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes being the most prevalent species in older individuals [4]. These changes in microbial composition can be influenced by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors, which play a significant role in the health and function of the microbiome as people age [8].   Overall, maintaining a healthy gut microbiome is crucial for promoting longevity and mitigating some of the negative effects associated with aging.",
