  "answer": "The provided context does not explicitly mention the integration of spatial transcriptomics approaches into GeneNetwork.org. However, it does describe GeneNetwork as a resource for systems biology and systems genetics, which includes large transcriptome datasets from multiple tissues [2], [9]. The platform is used to study relationships among markers, genes, and phenotypes, and to analyze genetic regulatory commonality and tissue structure and function [3], [4]. While spatial transcriptomics is not directly referenced, the existing capabilities of GeneNetwork in handling multi-omics data and performing systems genetics mapping [1], [5] suggest that it could potentially support spatial transcriptomics approaches to enhance understanding of tissue architecture and function.",
