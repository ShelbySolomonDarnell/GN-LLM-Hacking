  "answer": "Advancements in single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) provide more granular insights into cell-type-specific gene expression networks by allowing for the analysis of gene expression within the nuclei of cells, rather than relying on intact cells as in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) [1]. This method is particularly useful for profiling gene expression in complex tissues from frozen samples at the single-cell level, which can be challenging with other techniques [1].   Additionally, snRNA-seq can help clarify cell-type proportions and corresponding transcriptional profiles, as demonstrated in studies involving postmortem human brain tissue [9]. By isolating nuclei and performing snRNA-seq, researchers can achieve finer cell subtype resolution, which is crucial for understanding the heterogeneity within cell populations [7]. This level of detail is essential for constructing accurate cell-type-specific gene expression networks, as it allows for the identification of transcriptional changes and cell-type-specific gene expression patterns that might be obscured in bulk tissue analyses [3].   Overall, snRNA-seq enhances our ability to dissect complex tissues into their constituent cell types and understand the unique gene expression networks within each type, providing a more detailed and nuanced view of cellular function and interaction.",
