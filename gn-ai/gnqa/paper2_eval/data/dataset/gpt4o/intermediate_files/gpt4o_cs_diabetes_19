Monogenic vs. polygenic diabetes   Monogenic and polygenic diabetes are traditionally considered distinct, with  monogenic diabetes resulting from one highly penetrant variant in one gene in a given  individual, and polygenic diabetes resulting from the contribution of several variants with  smaller effects in the context of environmental/lifestyle factors.

  "answer": "Monogenic and polygenic diabetes are distinct forms of diabetes with different genetic underpinnings:  1. **Monogenic Diabetes**: This form of diabetes results from a mutation in a single gene that is highly penetrant, meaning it has a strong effect on the individual who carries it [1], [6]. Monogenic diabetes is often associated with defects in beta-cell function, leading to a decrease in the number or function of these cells [2]. It is typically characterized by early onset, often before the age of 25, and can include conditions like Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY) [5]. Monogenic diabetes is relatively rare, representing about 2%-5% of diabetes cases [2].  2. **Polygenic Diabetes**: In contrast, polygenic diabetes results from the combined effect of multiple genetic variants, each contributing a small effect, along with environmental and lifestyle factors [1], [6]. This form of diabetes is more common and is the predominant mode of inheritance in type 2 diabetes [7]. The genetic variants involved in polygenic diabetes do not have as strong an effect individually as those in monogenic diabetes, but together they contribute to the disease risk in the presence of other factors like obesity and sedentary lifestyle [3].  In summary, monogenic diabetes is caused by a single gene mutation with a strong effect, while polygenic diabetes involves multiple genes with smaller effects combined with environmental influences.",
