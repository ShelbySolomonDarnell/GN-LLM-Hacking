These weights are assessed from the regression coefcient associated with each locus. These combined genetics features and correlation matrices would signicantly assist the entire eld of genomics study [ 9]. These studies on",

Polygenic scores provide a quantitative metric of  an individuals inherited risk based on the cumulative impact of many common polymorphisms. Weights are generally assigned to each genetic variant according to the strength of their association with disease risk (effect estimate). Individuals are scored based on how many risk alleles they have for each variant (for example, zero, one, or two copies) included in the polygenic score.",

  "answer": "Polygenic risk scores (PRS) developed using GeneNetwork.org data enhance the prediction and prevention of complex diseases by providing a quantitative metric of an individual's inherited risk based on the cumulative impact of many common polymorphisms [7]. These scores aggregate the genetic risk of individual alleles across the genome, which can significantly improve the prediction of future disease occurrence and aid in early diagnosis, intervention, and prevention strategies [5]. PRS can complement established clinical risk factors and intervention paradigms, thereby enhancing early diagnosis and prevention efforts for diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2D) [6]. Additionally, PRS have emerged as promising biomarkers for predicting disease risk in various areas, including cardiovascular disorders and oncology [8]. By utilizing data from large consortia and genome-wide genotypes, the predictive value of these scores has substantially improved, allowing for a more comprehensive assessment of genetic risk [3].",
