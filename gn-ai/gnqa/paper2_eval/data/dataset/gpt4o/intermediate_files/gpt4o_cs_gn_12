  "answer": "A gene network is a graphical model comprised of nodes and edges, where the nodes typically represent genes, gene products, or other biological entities [1]. These networks illustrate how genes do not function in isolation but operate in complex networks that define the behavior of biological systems [2]. Understanding gene networks is crucial for interpreting the roles of individual genes within the broader context of these networks, which can provide insights into complex system behaviors, including diseases [1], [2]. By considering genes within their networks, researchers can better understand the interrelationships and regulatory mechanisms that contribute to phenotypic traits and disease processes [4].",
