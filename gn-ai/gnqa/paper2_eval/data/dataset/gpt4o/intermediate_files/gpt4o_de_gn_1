In systems genetics approach, different trait networks are related to different networks of gene and environmental variants to find global genetic modulation of the complex phenotype.

  "answer": "Recent advancements in network-based integrative genomics have significantly enhanced our understanding of complex trait architectures by enabling a more comprehensive analysis of the interactions between genetic and environmental factors. These advancements allow for the integration of gene variants and environmental factors to better understand the networks controlling complex traits [1]. The use of systems genetics approaches facilitates the connection of different trait networks with networks of gene and environmental variants, which helps in identifying the global genetic modulation of complex phenotypes [1].  Moreover, the integration of genotypic, expression, and other data within a Bayesian network framework has been shown to improve our mechanistic understanding of how DNA perturbations can induce changes in gene networks that ultimately affect disease outcomes [2]. This integrative approach provides a more detailed view of the polygenic and pleiotropic networks that modulate complex traits, such as those affecting the nervous system [5].  Overall, these advancements in network-based integrative genomics offer a more nuanced and interconnected view of complex trait architectures, moving beyond single-gene analyses to consider the broader network of interactions that contribute to phenotypic outcomes.",
