    "The fact that type 2 diabetes is a genetic disease is well known to clinicians by how it occurs in families, and by there being ethnic populations who are particularly high risk. The genetic link was clearly shown more than two decades ago by a famous study of identical twins in the U.K. that found essentially a 100% concordance rate for this disease if one twin developed type 2 diabetes, then the other one invariably developed it (9). However, this kind of study",
    "genetic factors play an important role in the susceptibility to T2D. The risk of the disease developing at some point of life is ~70% when both parents are diabetic and ~40% when one parent has T2D [ 4].

Thus, most patients have a positive family history, and  the lifetime risk for developing type 2 diabetes is increased up to 40% (more  than five times the background rate) by having a first degree relative with the  disease. If both parents have type 2 diabetes the risk to the offspring may be  as high as 70%. Available evidence supports a polygenic mode of  inheritance with a considerable environmental input. 1",

  "answer": "Family genetics play a significant role in the likelihood of developing diabetes. Several studies and observations highlight this connection:  1. Genetic factors are important in determining an individual's risk of developing diabetes [1]. 2. A family history of diabetes, particularly in first-degree relatives such as parents or siblings, is associated with a two- to fourfold increased risk of developing diabetes [3]. 3. Type 2 diabetes is strongly influenced by genetics, as evidenced by high concordance rates in identical twins, with studies showing a 58-75% concordance rate [5]. In some studies, the concordance rate is reported to be nearly 100% [6]. 4. The risk of developing type 2 diabetes is approximately 70% if both parents have the disease and about 40% if one parent is affected [7], [9]. 5. Type 2 diabetes clusters in families, and having a first-degree relative with the disease increases the lifetime risk significantly, up to 40% or more [9].  Overall, these findings underscore the strong genetic component in the susceptibility to diabetes, particularly type 2 diabetes.",
