Thus, the once esoteric topic of gene-environment interaction is now becoming mainstream and appealing to investigators across diversedisciplines; this has propelled major methodological in- novations for the discovery, replication, validation and translation of gene-environment interactions. The expo- nentiation of data resources for these purposes has demanded analytical solutions that address data dimen- sionality reduction. Although not yet extensively imple-",
    "addition to this, GeneNetwork can be used to study correlations between traits and to perform data mining in genomic regions containing candidates for quantitative trait genes (Hoffman et al., 2011).

Databases within GeneNetwork include the transcriptome database, the BXD published",
