  "answer": "Scientists ensure the accuracy of the data on GeneNetwork.org through several methods:  1. **Quality Control and Normalization**: Data are entered into GeneNetwork after being processed through systems like PhenoGen, which have extensive capabilities for normalization and quality control [3].  2. **Quality Checking and Preprocessing**: Phenotypic data undergo quality checks and preprocessing before being uploaded to GeneNetwork. This includes normalization, removal of outliers, and transformation of data to achieve a normal distribution [8].  3. **Data Curation and Informatics Support**: The GeneNetwork.org team provides excellent data curation and informatics support to maintain data accuracy [4].  These steps help ensure that the data on GeneNetwork.org is accurate and reliable for scientific research.",
