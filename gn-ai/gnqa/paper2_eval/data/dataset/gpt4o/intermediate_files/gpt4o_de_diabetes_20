Given that a variable epigenetic pattern can modulate the link between the SNP and trait, consideration of this interplay is critically important.

The combination of data from high-throughput approaches and association studies has provided compelling evidence that some epigenetic markers contribute to the risk of T2D [ 57,58].

  "answer": "Recent integrative genomics approaches, such as the combination of single-cell RNA sequencing and epigenomic profiling, have significantly advanced our understanding of cellular heterogeneity and gene regulatory networks in pancreatic beta cells under diabetic conditions. These approaches have allowed researchers to delve deeper into the transcriptional regulation of non-beta cell types, which may play crucial roles in the hallmark features of beta cell insufficiency and dysfunction associated with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) [1].   Single-cell RNA sequencing has been particularly instrumental in high-throughput diabetes research by enabling the sequencing of individual cells from human pancreatic islets. This is important given the heterogeneity within the islets of Langerhans, which consist of various cell types. By tracking genetic changes in individual cells, researchers can better understand the complex cellular landscape and the specific contributions of different cell types to diabetes pathogenesis [2].  Furthermore, epigenomic profiling adds another layer of complexity by revealing how epigenetic changes can modulate gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. These changes are crucial for maintaining the secretory capacity, survival, and functional identity of pancreatic islets, as well as their response to insulin [8]. The integration of these genomic and epigenomic data helps identify regulatory elements and pathways that could be targeted for therapeutic interventions, moving from correlation to causation in understanding diabetes [10].",
