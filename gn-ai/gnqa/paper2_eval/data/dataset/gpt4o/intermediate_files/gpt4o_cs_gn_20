  "answer": "The difference between looking at one gene and studying a whole gene network lies in the scope and context of the analysis. When examining a single gene, the focus is on understanding the role and function of that specific gene, often in isolation. This approach can be limited because it does not consider the interactions and relationships that gene may have with others.  In contrast, studying a whole gene network involves analyzing a system of interconnected genes, which provides a broader context. A gene network is a graphical model where nodes represent genes or gene products, and edges represent interactions between them [1]. This approach allows researchers to explore how multiple genes interact within biological pathways, potentially uncovering complex relationships and combined effects that a single-gene analysis might miss [2]. By studying gene networks, researchers can gain insights into the collective behavior of genes, which can be crucial for understanding complex diseases and biological functions [2]. Additionally, gene networks can help identify highly connected subgraphs that correspond to biologically relevant networks, aiding in the identification of causative genes and their regulatory roles [5].",
