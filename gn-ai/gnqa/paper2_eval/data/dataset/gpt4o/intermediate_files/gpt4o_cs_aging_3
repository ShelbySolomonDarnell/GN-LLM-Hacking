    "During the past century, remarkable progress has been  made in unveiling the mechanisms of aging. Genetic and molecular pathways that regulate healthspan and lifespan have been identified in various model organisms, provid-ing a rich knowledge base (Longo etal. 2015; Lopez-Otin etal. 2013, 2016; Singh etal. 2019).

    "Genetic studies have shown that aging can be slowed in mutants that are defective in a wide range of cellularprocesses (such as mitochondrial function, chromatin regu- lation, insulin signaling, tran scriptional regulation, and genome stability). This indicates that aging is a complex process driven by diverse molecular pathways and biochem- ical events. As such, a powerful approach to study aging is touse systems biology, which allows a multitude of factors",
    "Dietary interventions, including starvation and protein deprivation, can also alter patterns of DNA methyla- tion, potentially in a long-lasting manner [42, 43], including transgenerationally [26, 44].

Most likely,aging retardation at the molecular level by exercise isnot observed in all tissues, including some that maylimit lifespan. For example, if exercise does not reduceaging rates in replicative tissues, then it will not retardage-related tumor onset, which tends to limit maxi-mum lifespan.

  "answer": "To slow down genetic aging, several lifestyle choices can be beneficial:  1. **Dietary Restriction (DR)**: Reducing food intake without causing malnutrition has been shown to extend lifespan in various organisms. This approach improves healthspan by influencing nutrient-sensing signaling networks and metabolism [1].  2. **Healthy Diet and Physical Exercise**: Engaging in regular physical activity and maintaining a healthy diet can slow down aging and prevent or modify many chronic diseases prevalent in older adults. This contributes to successful aging, allowing individuals to achieve physical, social, and mental well-being [4].  3. **Caloric Restriction**: This is considered a reasonable anti-aging intervention, as it has been shown to slow aging in multiple species, including yeast, nematodes, fruit flies, and rodents [6].  4. **Exercise**: While exercise may not retard aging in all tissues, it can contribute to molecular-level aging retardation, which is beneficial for overall health and longevity [10].  These lifestyle choices, when combined, can help mitigate the effects of genetic aging and promote a longer, healthier life.",
