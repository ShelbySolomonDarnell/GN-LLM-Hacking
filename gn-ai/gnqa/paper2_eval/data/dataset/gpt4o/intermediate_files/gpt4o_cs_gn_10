  "answer": "GeneNetwork.org plays a significant role in personalized medicine by serving as an open-access, online data analysis resource for systems biology and systems genetics [1]. It is a tool for systems genetics and predictive medicine, which aims to predict and potentially avoid phenotypic outcomes such as diseases [2]. The platform supports the integration of networks of genes, transcripts, and traits, which is crucial for understanding complex genetic interactions and their implications for personalized medicine [10]. Additionally, GeneNetwork.org facilitates the comparison of data on drug responses with gene expression patterns, which is essential for tailoring therapeutic strategies to individual genetic profiles [9].",
