  "answer": "Advancements in machine learning algorithms contribute to the deconvolution of gene expression data in complex tissues by enabling the prediction of cell-type proportions from bulk genomics data. This computational deconvolution is crucial for understanding the relative abundance of various cell types within a tissue, which is a key step in analyzing gene expression data from complex tissues [1]. Additionally, machine learning methods, such as decision tree methods, are explored to model functional dependencies and predict co-expressed gene profiles, which can further aid in the deconvolution process by identifying regulatory elements and signals that vary with disease status [4]. These advancements allow for more accurate and insightful analysis of gene expression data, facilitating the identification of transcriptional changes and regulatory networks in complex tissues.",
