The number of genetic regions causally implicated is now 11 each for type 1 and type 2 diabetes [ 19], and is set to rise further.

    "It has proven to be challenging to isolate the genes underlying the genetic components conferring susceptibility to type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Unlike previous approaches, genome-wide association studies have extensively delivered on the promise of uncovering genetic determinants of complexdiseases, with a number of novel disease-associated variants being largelyreplicated by independent groups. This review provides an overview of these recent breakthroughs in the context of type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and",

At last, it seems, our understanding of the genetic basis of complex, multifactorial forms of diabetes is catching up with that of rarer, single-gene disorders.

  "answer": "Recent breakthroughs in understanding the genetic causes of diabetes include several key advancements:  1. The number of genetic regions causally implicated in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes has increased to 11 each, marking significant progress in identifying genetic factors associated with these conditions [1].  2. Genome-wide association studies have been particularly successful in uncovering genetic determinants of complex diseases like diabetes. These studies have identified a number of novel disease-associated variants, which have been largely replicated by independent research groups, highlighting their reliability and significance [2].  3. Advances in technology, such as the use of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chips, have enabled the analysis of up to a million genetic variations. This technological leap has greatly enhanced our understanding of the genetic basis of complex, multifactorial forms of diabetes, bringing it closer to the understanding of rarer, single-gene disorders [5].  4. Recent studies have yielded six new replicating gene regions associated with type 2 diabetes, providing new insights into the genetic architecture of the disease and suggesting potential directions for future research [8].  These breakthroughs represent a significant leap forward in the genetic understanding of diabetes, driven by technological advancements and collaborative research efforts.",
