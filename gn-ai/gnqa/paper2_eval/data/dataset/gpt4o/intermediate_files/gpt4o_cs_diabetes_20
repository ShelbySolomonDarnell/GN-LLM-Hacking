  "answer": "Studying the DNA of people with diabetes helps scientists find better treatments or cures in several ways:  1. **Identification of Genetic Determinants**: By performing genetic profiling on diabetic patients, scientists can identify genetic determinants that define the targets of current and future therapies. This leads to the development of therapies that are more specific to the genetic makeup of individuals with diabetes [1].  2. **Understanding Disease Mechanisms**: Genetic studies improve our understanding of the biological mechanisms that maintain glucose homeostasis and reveal molecular defects leading to chronic hyperglycemia. This knowledge can lead to the development of more specifically targeted antidiabetic drugs or even gene-based therapies [4].  3. **Pharmacogenetics**: Pharmacogenetic testing can be used to predict therapeutic responses to different classes of drugs for each patient, allowing for more personalized treatment plans [4].  4. **Discovery of New Therapeutic Targets**: A greater understanding of the genetic and epigenetic basis of diabetes can enable the discovery of new therapeutic targets, potentially leading to novel treatments for diabetes and its complications [3].  5. **Stratification of Diabetes Subclasses**: By analyzing DNA variations and their interactions with environmental factors, scientists can stratify type 2 diabetes into subclasses. This stratification allows for more effective treatment strategies tailored to specific genetic and lifestyle interactions [8].  6. **Identification of Key Genetic Elements**: Genetic studies can identify key genetic elements that determine susceptibility to diabetes, disease progression, and responsiveness to specific therapies. This information helps in identifying novel targets for future interventions [9].  Overall, studying the DNA of people with diabetes provides critical insights that drive the development of more effective and personalized treatments.",
