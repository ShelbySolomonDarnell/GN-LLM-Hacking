    "users can take advantage of a systems genetics approach (Rosen et al., 2003, 2007). While the candidate gene approach asks which one gene mutation causes a particular disease, the systems genetics approach explores which phenotypes and diseases result from diverse sets of genetic and molecular markers (Rosen et al., 2003, 2007).

  "answer": "GeneNetwork.org aids in finding the genetic causes of common diseases by utilizing a systems genetics approach. This approach allows researchers to explore which phenotypes and diseases result from diverse sets of genetic and molecular markers, rather than focusing on single gene mutations [1]. GeneNetwork provides access to a wide variety of data, including genotypes (e.g., SNPs) and phenotypes, which can be used to study complex traits [7]. The platform integrates data on gene expression, protein interactions, and DNA-protein binding to construct biological networks that are predictive of disease [4]. Additionally, GeneNetwork offers correlation and mapping strategies for assessing associations among multiple genes and quantitative trait loci (QTLs), facilitating the study of complex traits [5]. This makes GeneNetwork a powerful tool for predictive medicine and systems genetics, helping researchers understand the genetic underpinnings of common diseases [6].",
