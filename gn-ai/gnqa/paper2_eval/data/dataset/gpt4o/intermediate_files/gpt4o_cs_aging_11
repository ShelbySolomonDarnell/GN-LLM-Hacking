  "answer": "Recent discoveries in the genetics of aging include the identification of a number of genes capable of altering the aging process significantly in animal models and even in some humans [2]. Additionally, recent efforts have focused on isolating aging mutants through mutagenesis experiments to determine the mechanistic basis for unusual life spans, leading to the discovery of genes that can either enhance or reduce life span [4]. These findings contribute to a growing understanding of the genetic factors influencing aging and longevity.",
  "question": "What recent discoveries have been made about the genetics of aging?"
