    "Effect of age on DNA repair Research over the past decades suggest that many steps in DNA metabolism are altered with age in a variety of tissues and animal models (56,57). The relation of DNArepair to aging has been studied by measuring the ability of cells from organisms of various life spans to repair DNA damage and by experiments that have comparedthe ability of cells from young and old organisms to repair DNA damage. Interest was peaked by the original",

Impairment of DNA repair mechanisms results in accelerated agingand/or cancer. 2. Evidence in humans and model organisms supports the conclusions that with age (a) endogenous sources of genotoxins increase, ( b) DNA repair capacity declines, and (c) levels of DNA damage and mutations increase.",
    "Several lines of evidence suggest that DNA repair capacity might decrease with age. However,it should be noted that measuring DNA repair in tissues is challenging and that the validity ofsurrogate markers of repair capacity is not well established. For example, a reduction in expression of DNA repair genes/proteins is not proven to impact DNA repair. Frequently, the reduction in",

This theory has evolved",

There is some evidence that DNA damage accumulates with age in some tissues ( Maslov et al., 2013 ), but the exact nature of the damage remains unclear. Indeed, even these low levels of spontaneous DNA damage may represent a steady state due to continu- ous repair and induction of new damage. However, DNA damage can cause certain aging phenotypes by activating cellular responses, such",

  "answer": "DNA repair plays a significant role in aging by maintaining the integrity and stability of the nuclear genome. Impairment of DNA repair mechanisms can result in accelerated aging and/or cancer [2]. As organisms age, endogenous sources of genotoxins increase, DNA repair capacity declines, and levels of DNA damage and mutations increase [2]. This accumulation of DNA damage is associated with aging phenotypes, as DNA damage can activate cellular responses that contribute to aging [6]. The DNA damage theory of aging suggests that genomic instability, caused by accumulated DNA damage, plays a causal role in aging [5]. Additionally, the burden of DNA lesions is greater in older mammals compared to younger ones, indicating that DNA repair is crucial for mitigating the effects of aging [5].",
