    "Metabolism Studies show that calorie restriction is the most consistent means to prolong life  expectancy and health across several experimental models [55], ranging from yeasts  to primates. It not only increases life expectancy, but it also delays the onset of many  features and hallmarks of ageing, including age-related diseases. Transcriptional  profiles are currently being applied and investigated. One of them is a caloric restric-",

    "Calorie restriction, a dietary regimen that extends  the lifespan of numerous organisms, also delays the  majority of age-related gene-expression changes in  mice and, to a certain extent, in flies45,50. It is currently  unclear whether the effect of calorie restriction on gene  expression underlies its beneficial effect on lifespan or is merely a consequence thereof. Findings in yeast suggest  that there may be a causal link: Sir2 not only facilitates  heterochromatin and promotes DNA stability, but is",

    "A key question still unresolved is to what extent the mechanisms of aging are conserved between species with vastly different lifespans. Some studies suggest that similar mechanisms are involved in aging in many species. Forexample, caloric restriction extends lifespan in yeast, worms,ies, mice, and primates (Weindruch 2003). Additionally,signaling through the insulin-like growth factor pathway,chromatin regulation by sir2,and oxidative damage have each",

  "answer": "Caloric restriction extends lifespan across various species through several key molecular mechanisms:  1. **Sirtuin Activation**: Caloric restriction may exert some of its effects through the sirtuin family of genes, particularly SIR2, which is known to prolong lifespan in organisms like yeast, worms, and flies [3], [4]. Sirtuins are involved in chromatin regulation and promoting DNA stability, which are crucial for maintaining cellular health and longevity [4].  2. **Insulin-like Signaling Pathways**: In mammals, caloric restriction is thought to modulate aging through the insulin-like signaling pathways. This mechanism is also observed in organisms like C. elegans and Drosophila, where it plays a role in regulating lifespan [6].  3. **Oxidative Stress Reduction**: Caloric restriction is associated with reduced oxidative damage, which is a significant factor in aging. This reduction in oxidative stress is a common mechanism observed across different species [9].  4. **AMPK Activation**: In mammals, caloric restriction has been linked to the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which plays a role in energy homeostasis and has protective effects on the aged myocardium [10].  These mechanisms highlight the complex interplay of genetic and metabolic pathways through which caloric restriction can extend lifespan across diverse species.",
