  "answer": "Genes affect the aging process in humans through complex interactions and pathways. Research has shown that single genes can regulate aging in model organisms, indicating that aging can be genetically manipulated [2]. Hundreds of genes have been identified that modulate longevity in these organisms, and some of these genes and their associated pathways, such as the insulin/IGF1/GH pathway, have been shown to affect longevity across different species, suggesting that some mechanisms of aging are evolutionarily conserved [3].   In humans, it has been more challenging to identify specific longevity candidate genes, but studies have shown that certain genes associated with aging in model organisms are evolutionarily conserved and may be relevant to human aging [5]. Additionally, approximately 4% of genes analyzed in a study of postmortem human brain tissue showed significant age-related expression changes, indicating that these genes play central roles in processes like synaptic plasticity, vesicular transport, and mitochondrial function [8].   Overall, while aging is a complex process involving multiple genes and their interactions with the environment, genetic studies in model organisms provide insights that may be applicable to understanding human aging [9].",
