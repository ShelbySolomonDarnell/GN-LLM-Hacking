QTL mapping of gene expression traits  allows us to identify eQTLs; genomic regions that have a regulatory effect on  those expression traits.

  "answer": "Recent developments in quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping have significantly refined our understanding of gene regulatory variants in several ways:  1. **Identification of eQTLs**: QTL mapping of gene expression traits allows for the identification of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), which are genomic regions that have a regulatory effect on gene expression traits. These eQTLs can be categorized into local eQTLs, which are located near the gene encoding the transcript, and distant eQTLs, which are located elsewhere in the genome [2]. This distinction helps in understanding the regulatory architecture of the genome.  2. **Increased Resolution and Confidence**: With advancements in DNA sequencing and the availability of whole-genome databases and gene expression data from various tissues, researchers can use bioinformatic tools to identify candidate genes with greater confidence for further functional validations [1]. This enhances the precision of QTL mapping in pinpointing regulatory variants.  3. **Functional Mapping and Hypothesis Generation**: QTL mapping studies, such as those beginning with yeast, have used gene expression as the phenotype to infer regulatory control. Although these studies are not conclusive, they help narrow down potential regulatory candidates, generate hypotheses for further testing, and construct regulatory networks in silico [3].  4. **Detection of Secondary QTLs and Epistatic Interactions**: Recent developments allow for the identification of large numbers of less strong, secondary QTLs that were previously obscured by background noise. This opens up new possibilities for analyses, such as identifying epistatic interactions, which can reveal pathways of genetic control within the studied tissue [4].  5. **Integration with Expression Analysis**: The integration of genetic variation in associated loci with expression analysis data through eQTL studies helps define regulatory relationships. This approach provides insights into the physiological consequences of causal variants, aiding in the translation of findings into diagnostic tests and risk evaluation [8].  Overall, these advancements in QTL mapping enhance our understanding of the complex regulatory mechanisms underlying gene expression and trait variation.",
