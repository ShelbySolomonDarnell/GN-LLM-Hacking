    "Dietary interventions, including starvation and protein deprivation, can also alter patterns of DNA methyla- tion, potentially in a long-lasting manner [42, 43], including transgenerationally [26, 44]. Dietary, genetic and pharmacological interventions that improve health during aging and extend lifespan induce long-lasting changes in gene expression that mediate their effects.

Nevertheless, it does seem that manyso-called longevity genes, as well as dietary restriction, appear to extend not only life span, but also health span (Kauffman et al., 2010; Luo et al., 2010 ). In that regard, it does appear that it is possible to experimentally slow the rate of aging. Still, in each case, aging does continue on as if there is some",

Although genetic and environmental interventions have clearly proven to be effective in prolonging life span, we postulate thatthose interventions, as well as the rejuvenating interventions described above, are, in fact, acting primarily to modify theepigenome. Consistent with this, genetic interventions directlytargeting the epigenome can extend life span ( Greer et al., 2010 ). Studying aging and rejuvenation through the lens of",

    "In addition to genes associated with aging, research has focused on identifying genes associated with the life- extending effects of CR. One method is to identify genesthat decrease or cancel out the life-extending effects of CRwhen mutated (Gems et al., 2002; Bishop and Guarente,2007). More than 100 such genes have been identified inmodel organisms (D. Wuttke, C. Vora, J. P. de Magalhes,unpublished observations).

  "answer": "Yes, there are known lifestyle interventions that can positively impact genes related to aging. Dietary interventions, such as dietary restriction (DR) and calorie restriction, have been shown to alter patterns of DNA methylation and induce long-lasting changes in gene expression that improve health during aging and extend lifespan [1], [8]. These interventions can modify the epigenome, which is linked to the biology of aging [5]. Additionally, glucose restriction has been shown to extend human cellular lifespan through SIRT1-mediated epigenetic and genetic mechanisms [7].",
