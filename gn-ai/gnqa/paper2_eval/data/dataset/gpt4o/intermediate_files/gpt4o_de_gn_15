  "answer": "Incorporating epigenomic data, such as histone modification maps, into the gene networks on GeneNetwork.org has several implications:  1. **Enhanced Functional Analysis**: By integrating epigenetic data, the predictive functional analysis of SNPs can be improved. This is because epigenetic data can highlight regions of DNA that are accessible or inaccessible to protein binding by transcription factors and other regulatory proteins, which can affect gene expression and regulation [4].  2. **Prioritization of Regulatory Variants**: The incorporation of genome-wide histone modification signatures, as revealed by collaborative efforts like the ENCODE Project and Roadmap Epigenomics, allows for the prioritization of functional regulatory variants. This can be particularly useful in mapping studies and databases, enhancing the understanding of regulatory features in various tissues and cell lines [2].  3. **Understanding Gene Expression Variation**: By studying the genetics of epigenetics, it is possible to reveal genes that directly or indirectly affect epigenetic gene states. This approach can help estimate the percentage of variation in gene expression that can be explained by different epigenetic conformations, thus providing a deeper understanding of gene regulation [3].  4. **Resource for Predictive Medicine and Systems Genetics**: The integration of multi-omics data, including epigenomic data, makes GeneNetwork.org a valuable resource for predictive medicine and systems genetics. This integration supports more comprehensive analyses and enhances the platform's utility for research and clinical applications [7].  Overall, incorporating epigenomic data into GeneNetwork.org enriches the platform's analytical capabilities, offering deeper insights into gene regulation and expression, and supporting advanced research in genetics and epigenetics.",
