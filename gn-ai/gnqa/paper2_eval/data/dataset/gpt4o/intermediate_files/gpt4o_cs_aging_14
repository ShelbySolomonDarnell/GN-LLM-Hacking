Evidence from animal systems showsa major impact of the environment on aging, yet envi-ronmental manipulations of aging act through genesand proteins, usually by triggering signaling pathwaysand modulating gene expression. In fact, some geneshave been shown in model organisms to have varyingeffects on lifespan depending on diet (Heikkinen et al.,2009). Genes that can regulate aging in model organ-isms cannot be directly applied to humans through",
    "Several studies show the influence of the environment on the ageing process [24].  Environmental factors may affect homeostasis and lead to the development of dis- eases, thus affecting the quality of life in older age [25]. They also produce cellular  damage, which causes an accelerated shortening of the telomeres at the genetic  level, accompanied by changes in DNA methylation, acetylation or deacetylation  of histones, among others. Altogether, these changes induce an aberrant gene",
    "changes are generated during the aging process. For a long time it has been believed that epigenetic modications occurring during aging may depend on environmental factors. This idea is attractive because, if true, epigenetics could provide a link between the environment, disease and aging. It also opens the possibility of targeted intervention aimed, for example, at improving healthspan or healthy aging. Thus, the rst question is whether specic environmental factors can directly induce specic epigenetic",
    "In addition, environmental factors influence the organism s ability to withstand the increase in entropy with aging: for example, caloric restriction and smoking can exert opposite effects on the rate ofaging (Colman et al. 2009 ; Fraser and Shavlik 2001 ). Both protective alleles and a benevolent environment contribute to excess physiological capacity, which in turn indirectly determines an individual s healthy life span and longevity (Martin et al. 2007 ).

Therefore, understanding ge-nome-environment interactions in the context of agingcan be a powerful approach to identify attractive targetsfor drug design.",

It is well-known that aging is influenced by a combin- ation of genetic and environmental factors. Previous twin stud- ies have shown that the genetic contribution to general human longevity is about 2030% [ 4,5], whereas environmental factors in human aging and longevity still account for the largest effect.

Findings from model organisms haverevealed that aging is a surprisingly plastic processthat can be manipulated by both genetic and environ-mental factors.

  "answer": "The environment interacts with genes to influence aging through several mechanisms:  1. **Signaling Pathways and Gene Expression**: Environmental factors can trigger signaling pathways and modulate gene expression, impacting aging. For example, certain genes have varying effects on lifespan depending on environmental factors like diet [1].  2. **Epigenetic Modifications**: Environmental factors can lead to changes in DNA methylation, acetylation, or deacetylation of histones, which are epigenetic modifications that influence gene expression. These changes can result in cellular damage and accelerated aging, such as the shortening of telomeres [2], [6].  3. **Epigenetics as a Link**: Epigenetic modifications provide a potential link between the environment, disease, and aging. This suggests that specific environmental factors might directly induce specific epigenetic changes, which could be targeted for interventions aimed at improving healthspan or promoting healthy aging [3].  4. **Physiological Capacity and Longevity**: Environmental factors, along with protective genetic alleles, contribute to an individual's physiological capacity, indirectly determining healthy lifespan and longevity. For instance, caloric restriction and smoking have opposite effects on the rate of aging [4].  5. **Plasticity of Aging**: Aging is a plastic process that can be manipulated by both genetic and environmental factors. Understanding these interactions can help identify targets for anti-aging therapies, potentially through diet, lifestyle, and pharmacological interventions [5], [10].  Overall, the interaction between the environment and genes is complex and involves multiple pathways and mechanisms that collectively influence the aging process.",
