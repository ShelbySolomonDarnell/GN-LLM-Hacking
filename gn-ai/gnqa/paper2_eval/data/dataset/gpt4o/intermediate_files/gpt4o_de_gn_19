One notable method is the use of network identification by regression (NIR), which has been applied to identify novel pathways in the context of aging and lifespan [2]. Additionally, network-based approaches have revealed six pathways and six key genes that might play pivotal roles in regulating longevity, providing new insights into the mechanisms of longevity [6].
