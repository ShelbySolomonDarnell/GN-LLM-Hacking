  "answer": "Yes, GeneNetwork.org can be used to learn about genetic influences on behavior. It is a comprehensive resource equipped with tools and features for studying genetic correlates to neurobehavioral phenotypes [5]. The platform includes a phenotype database with data on behavioral traits, among others, which can be used for correlation and network analyses to identify relationships with genetic data [4]. Additionally, GeneNetwork focuses on correlations of behavioral phenotypes with gene expression levels in recombinant inbred and inbred panels of mice and rats, which helps in identifying candidate genes for complex traits [6]. The resource is designed for the multivariate genetic analysis of complex traits, including behavior, in genetic reference populations [9].",
