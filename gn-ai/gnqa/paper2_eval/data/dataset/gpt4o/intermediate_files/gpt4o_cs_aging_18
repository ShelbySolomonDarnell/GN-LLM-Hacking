  "answer": "Researchers use model organisms like yeast and worms to study human aging due to their simpler genomes, short lifespans, and the ease with which they can be genetically and environmentally manipulated. These characteristics make them ideal for identifying and characterizing genes and signaling pathways involved in aging [3].   Yeast, specifically Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is a highly informative model for aging studies because of its genetic tools and the ability to measure aging through replicative or chronological lifespan assays [2], [5]. Yeast has been extensively used to identify genes and interventions responsible for lifespan extension, providing insights into the aging processes of all eukaryotic organisms [10].  Similarly, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is another widely used model organism in biogerontology. Researchers study these organisms to understand whether the aging process is evolutionarily conserved and to what degree mechanisms in these simpler organisms can be indicative of aging mechanisms in humans [1], [6]. These model organisms help explore both genetic and environmental determinants of lifespan, contributing to hypotheses surrounding extended lifespan and healthspan [7].",
