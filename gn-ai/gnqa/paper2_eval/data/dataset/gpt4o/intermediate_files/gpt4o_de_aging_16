  "answer": "Oxidative stress contributes to cellular aging through the accumulation of oxidative damage in various macromolecules, which leads to a decline in cellular function. This process occurs due to an imbalance between prooxidants and antioxidants, resulting in a steady-state accumulation of oxidative damage that increases with age [1]. The oxidative stress theory of aging posits that damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) plays a critical role in determining lifespan, as it leads to the deterioration of biochemical and physiological processes [4].   Oxidative damage affects all cellular macromolecules, including lipids, proteins, and DNA, and this damage increases with age [3]. The accumulation of such damage is a key hallmark of aging physiology [5]. Specifically, oxidative damage to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and the generation of ROS from the mitochondrial electron transport chain are significant contributors to this process [6].   Overall, the accumulation of oxidative damage is causally linked to aging and death, as it impairs cellular processes and bioenergetics, leading to the progressive loss of functional efficiency in cells [2], [8].",
