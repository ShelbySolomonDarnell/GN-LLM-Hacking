    "standing the cause and mechanisms of aging is imperative in assisting to suppress age-related diseases and promote healthylongevity. It is well-known that aging is influenced by a combin- ation of genetic and environmental factors. Previous twin stud- ies have shown that the genetic contribution to general human longevity is about 2030% [ 4,5], whereas environmental factors in human aging and longevity still account for the largest effect. Epigenetic factors influence the regulation of gene expres-",

    "tion for decades, the underlying molecular genetic causes of and responses to aging remain an area of active study. Research from model systems hascharacterized a range of physiological and molecular phenotypes associated with aging. These include genomic instability caused by accumulation of DNA damage, dysregulation of repair mechanisms, and telomere attri- tion; epigenetic alterations; dysregulation of transcription; loss of proteostasis; cellular senescence; and deregulated",
    "143 The molecular bases of ageing are multi factorial, but there are nine distinctive  features related to this process, which include genomic instability, telomere shorten- ing, de-regulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence,  stem cell exhaustion, altered cellular senescence, loss of proteostasis and a change  in the patterns of epigenetic modifications [4, 5].

  "answer": "The main genetic factors that influence aging include:  1. **Genomic Instability**: Aging is associated with the accumulation of DNA damage and the dysregulation of repair mechanisms, leading to genomic instability [9].  2. **Telomere Attrition**: The shortening of telomeres, which are protective caps at the ends of chromosomes, is a significant factor in aging [9], [10].  3. **Epigenetic Alterations**: Changes in epigenetic marks, which regulate gene expression without altering the DNA sequence, play a crucial role in aging [2], [4], [9], [10].  4. **Deregulated Nutrient Sensing**: The pathways that sense and respond to nutrients become deregulated with age, affecting longevity [10].  5. **Mitochondrial Dysfunction**: Mitochondria, the energy-producing organelles in cells, become less efficient with age, contributing to the aging process [10].  6. **Cellular Senescence**: The process by which cells lose the ability to divide and function properly is a hallmark of aging [9], [10].  7. **Loss of Proteostasis**: The ability of cells to maintain protein homeostasis declines with age, leading to the accumulation of damaged proteins [9], [10].  8. **Stem Cell Exhaustion**: The decline in the regenerative capacity of stem cells contributes to aging [10].  These factors collectively shape the complex genetic landscape of aging, influencing the expression of aging phenotypes and lifespan [7].",
