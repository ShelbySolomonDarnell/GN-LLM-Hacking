    "users can take advantage of a systems genetics approach (Rosen et al., 2003, 2007). While the candidate gene approach asks which one gene mutation causes a particular disease, the systems genetics approach explores which phenotypes and diseases result from diverse sets of genetic and molecular markers (Rosen et al., 2003, 2007). The majority of data sets in GeneNetwork are collected from GRPs consisting of hundreds of diverse, inbred strains of",

  "answer": "The study of genetic pleiotropy has been advanced by data available on GeneNetwork.org through several key developments:  1. **Multi-Omics Analysis and Data from Multiple Species**: GeneNetwork.org has incorporated data from 10 different species and supports multi-omics analysis, which allows researchers to explore genetic pleiotropy across a wide range of organisms and biological data types. This comprehensive approach provides a richer understanding of how genes can influence multiple traits or diseases [4].  2. **Systems Genetics Approach**: The platform enables a systems genetics approach, which contrasts with the traditional candidate gene approach. Instead of focusing on single gene mutations, it explores the relationships between diverse genetic and molecular markers and their resulting phenotypes and diseases. This approach is particularly useful for studying pleiotropy, as it considers the complex interactions and shared pathways that can lead to multiple phenotypic effects from a single genetic locus [5].  3. **Open Web Resource**: GeneNetwork.org is an open web resource, making it accessible to a wide range of researchers. This accessibility facilitates collaborative research and data sharing, which are crucial for advancing the study of pleiotropy by allowing researchers to build on each other's findings and methodologies [8].  These features collectively enhance the ability to study genetic pleiotropy by providing comprehensive data, advanced analytical tools, and a collaborative platform for researchers.",
