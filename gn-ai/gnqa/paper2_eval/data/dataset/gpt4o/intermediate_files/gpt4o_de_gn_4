  "answer": "Analyzing large-scale transcriptomic data within GeneNetwork.org presents several computational challenges and solutions:  1. **Computational Complexity and Memory Requirements**: The analysis of large networks is computationally complex and requires significant memory resources. Traditional methods may not be ideal for handling such large datasets [5].  2. **Scalable Algorithms**: To address these challenges, scalable parallel algorithms have been developed. These algorithms are designed to handle fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) problems, which are crucial for managing large-scale data efficiently [6].  3. **High-Performance Implementations**: Genome-scale algorithms and high-performance implementations are utilized to facilitate the genetic analysis of gene transcription, making it possible to manage and analyze large volumes of data effectively [2].  4. **Visualization and Biological Validation**: Visualization methods and biological validation are essential to translate complex data into understandable results. These methods help in comparing graphs collected in a systems genetic context, reflecting differences in time, tissue, and treatment effects [3].  5. **Tools for Large-Scale Network Construction**: Tools like WGCNA, GeneNet, ARACNE, and SPACE are specifically designed to construct gene networks at very large scales. These tools also provide functionalities for analyzing and visualizing resulting networks, including identifying subnetworks [5].  These solutions collectively help in overcoming the computational challenges associated with large-scale transcriptomic data analysis within GeneNetwork.org.",
