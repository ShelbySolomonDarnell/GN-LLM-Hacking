  "answer": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression related to diabetes by acting at the post-transcriptional level to control their target genes. They are involved in several crucial pathways associated with diabetes, including insulin secretion, cholesterol biosynthesis, fat metabolism, and adipogenesis [2]. miRNAs also play significant roles in pancreatic islet development, beta-cell dysfunction, insulin synthesis and secretion, and insulin resistance, which are key factors in the pathology of both Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM and T2DM) [6]. Additionally, specific miRNAs have been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications, such as diabetic nephropathy, where miRNAs like miR-192, miR-216a, miR-217, and miR-377 are up-regulated [2]. These miRNAs can modulate the actions of growth factors and inflammatory factors, further influencing diabetic complications [5].",
