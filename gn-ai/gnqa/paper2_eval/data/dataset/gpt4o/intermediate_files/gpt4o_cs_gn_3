The importance of defining biological networks and predicting molecular interactions has been emphasized by several reports [1,2].

  "answer": "GeneNetwork.org provides several tools and resources to explore how genes interact with each other. It is a bioinformatics tool that allows users to explore systems genetics data, which is crucial for defining biological networks and predicting molecular interactions [1]. GeneNetwork offers correlation and mapping strategies to assess associations among multiple genes and quantitative trait loci (QTLs), facilitating the study of complex traits [3]. Additionally, it provides access to a wide variety of data, including genotypes and phenotypes, which can illuminate relationships between different levels of a biological system, such as the genome, transcriptome, and phenome [6]. GeneNetwork also computes gene-gene co-expression correlations, which are essential for understanding gene interactions [9].",
