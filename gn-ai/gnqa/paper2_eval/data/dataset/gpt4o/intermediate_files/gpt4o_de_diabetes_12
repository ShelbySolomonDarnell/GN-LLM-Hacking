  "answer": "The latest findings on the role of non-coding RNAs in the pathogenesis of diabetes highlight several key aspects:  1. **Role of lncRNAs in Diabetes**: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are implicated in mediating complex pathological mechanisms of diabetes. They are involved in post-transcriptional regulation and are associated with orchestrated networks that influence diabetes pathogenesis [5]. LncRNAs are considered better therapeutic targets due to their specific functions in regulating cellular pathways and their expression patterns that correlate with the progression of diabetes [7].  2. **Epigenetic Influence**: Non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs and lncRNAs, can influence epigenetic mechanisms. They can promote the expression of pathological genes through post-transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms, contributing to metabolic memory and sustained gene expression in diabetic conditions [4].  3. **Regulation of Islet Function**: LncRNAs have been shown to regulate pancreatic islet function, which is central to understanding diabetes pathophysiology. For instance, the lncRNA H19 has been implicated in islet development and function [8].  4. **MicroRNAs in Disease**: MicroRNAs (miRs) play critical roles in various diseases, including diabetes, by influencing proliferation, differentiation, and development [2].  These findings underscore the importance of non-coding RNAs as regulatory players in diabetes and its complications, offering potential avenues for therapeutic intervention.",
