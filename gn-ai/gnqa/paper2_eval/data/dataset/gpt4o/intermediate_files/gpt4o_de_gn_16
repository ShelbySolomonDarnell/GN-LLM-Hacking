As a result of this, disease associated SNPs have been shown to fall in gene regulatory elements ( Chen and Tian, 2016; Fadason et al., 2017; Farh et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2014; Schierding et al., 2015 ).",

  "answer": "Recent findings on 3D genome organization have significantly enhanced our understanding of functional genomic networks in several ways:  1. **Co-regulation through Spatial Organization**: The 3D chromatin structure is known to couple nuclear compartmentalization of chromatin domains with the control of gene activity, which contributes to cell-specific gene expression [1]. This spatial organization within the nucleus suggests that chromosomal and spatial co-localization may indicate co-regulation of genes, thereby influencing functional genomic networks.  2. **Regulation by Distant Elements**: There is a growing awareness that the three-dimensional juxtaposition of DNA regions within nuclei allows genes to be regulated by elements located at a distance from the gene itself [4]. This understanding helps explain how disease-associated SNPs can fall within gene regulatory elements, thus affecting genomic networks and potentially leading to disease.  3. **Integration with Functional Annotations**: Advances in identifying functional genomic elements through various annotations, such as those from the ENCODE project, have been complemented by insights into 3D genome organization. This integration helps in identifying potential regulatory variants and understanding their roles within genomic networks [2].  These findings collectively contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of how genes are regulated within the complex spatial architecture of the genome, thereby enhancing our knowledge of functional genomic networks.",
