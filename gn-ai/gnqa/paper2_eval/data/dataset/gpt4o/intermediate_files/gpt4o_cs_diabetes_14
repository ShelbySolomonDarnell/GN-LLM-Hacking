  "answer": "Yes, lifestyle changes can affect genetic risk factors for diabetes. Evidence from both observational studies and clinical trials suggests that lifestyle factors can modify the genetic effects on the risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) [1]. Lifestyle modifications, such as improvements in dietary quality and increased physical activity, have been shown to be particularly effective in preventing and managing type 2 diabetes, even in individuals with a high genetic risk [6]. Furthermore, behavioral changes can substantially mitigate the diabetogenic effects of individual or multiple risk alleles, indicating that the adverse effects of some established T2D-associated loci may be greatly attenuated by appropriate lifestyle changes [9].",
