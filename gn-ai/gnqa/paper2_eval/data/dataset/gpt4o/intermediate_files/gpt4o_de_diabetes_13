    "(GWAS) in diverse populations have identified hundreds  of genetic loci associated with T2D [79]. Polygenic risk  scores (PRS), which aggregate the genetic risk of individ - ual alleles across the genome, are thus promising to pre - dict future T2D occurrence and improve early diagnosis,  intervention, and prevention of T2D [1015]. However,  to date, T2D PRS were most widely developed and vali - dated in individuals of European descent. Given that the  predictive performance of PRS often attenuates in non-",
    "in advance. Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) were proposed by Duncan L. et al. [ 8] for risk analysis using the sum of the weight of each risk-associated locus of genomic sequence obtained from the corresponding evidence. These weights are assessed from the regression coefcient associated with each locus. These combined genetics features and correlation matrices would signicantly assist the entire eld of genomics study [ 9]. These studies on",
    "performance. Conclusions: By integrating T2D GWAS from multiple populations, we developed and validated a transancestry PRS,  and demonstrated its potential as a meaningful index of risk among diverse patients in clinical settings. Our efforts  represent the first step towards the implementation of the T2D PRS into routine healthcare.

    "Owing to their small effect sizes, SNP associations have very little clinical applicability for risk prediction.   A polygenic risk score (PRS) attempts to estimate the combined risk from multiple SNPs that have been associated with a certain trait with genome-wide sig-nificance. By accounting for a large proportion of the  genetic variance underlying a trait, the overall effect size",

  "answer": "The interaction between multiple polygenic risk scores (PRS) can improve the prediction of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes by combining information from various genetic loci associated with these diseases. This approach allows for a more comprehensive assessment of an individual's genetic risk. Specifically, combining information from common risk polymorphisms has been shown to improve disease prediction for Type 2 diabetes [3]. Additionally, partitioning polygenic scores according to factors of disease heterogeneity and mapping genetic loci to different immune-cell subtypes can enhance the predictive power of PRS, particularly for Type 2 diabetes [9]. These strategies leverage the aggregation of genetic risk from multiple sources, thereby capturing a larger proportion of the genetic variance underlying these traits and improving early diagnosis, intervention, and prevention efforts [4].",
