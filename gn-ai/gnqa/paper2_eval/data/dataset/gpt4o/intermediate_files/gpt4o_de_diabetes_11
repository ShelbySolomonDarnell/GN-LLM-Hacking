Under this scenario, themissing heritability could be located in common orlow-frequency and rare variants in noncoding regionsof the genome.

  "answer": "Rare variants identified through whole-genome sequencing contribute to the heritability of Type 2 diabetes by potentially explaining some of the \"missing heritability\" that common variants identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) do not account for. While GWAS have identified many common variants associated with Type 2 diabetes, these explain only a fraction of the heritability of the disease [4]. The missing heritability could be located in low-frequency and rare variants, particularly in noncoding regions of the genome [1]. However, studies have shown that rare coding variants, especially when clustered in a small number of genes, are unlikely to account for much of the missing heritability [10]. Instead, if rare coding variants are significant, they are likely scattered across many genes [10]. Therefore, while rare variants may contribute to the heritability of Type 2 diabetes, their exact role and impact remain to be fully elucidated, and larger multi-population studies are needed to reliably identify rare variants exclusively associated with Type 2 diabetes [6].",
