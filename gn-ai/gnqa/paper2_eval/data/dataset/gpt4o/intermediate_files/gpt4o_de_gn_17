    "[111], and for generation of networks based on known gene  interactions such as GeneMania [112] and Cytoscape [113], as well as for identifying cross-species orthology relation-ships [114], network-based thinking has been increasingly applied to the study of aging and lifespan [115-118].

    "Here we will focus on gene network inference algorithms (the inuence approach). A description of other methods based on the physical approach and more details oncomputational aspects can be found in (Beer and Tavazoie,2004; Tadesse et al, 2004; Faith and Gardner, 2005; Prakash and Tompa, 2005; Ambesi and di Bernardo, 2006; Foat et al, 2006).

    "NIA[360] may help to infer a putative function by linking unkn own genes to genes known from previous studies to show a similar e xpres- sion pattern. We can also characterize unknown genes by thei r evolu- tionary, loss-of-function and network interaction proper ties to prioritize candidate variants[184] and even predict disease inherita nce mode to a certain degree[153].

    "A number of techniques have been proposed for network inference. Existing techniques for nding gene networks can be broadly cate-gorized as (i) computational approaches, and (ii) literature-based approaches. The computational approach mainly uses statistical, machine learning, or soft-computing techniques [ 14,15] as discov- ery tools. On the other hand, a literature-based approach gathers relevant published information on genes and their interrelation-",
    "addition, data from linkage or association studies (e.g. GWAS), or from high -throughput genetic screening  experiments (e.g. CRISPR screening), or from animal gain -or-loss- of function studies, or from the gene -drug  interactions, can also be exploited to  predict potential gene functions. Integration of GeneBridge with data from  these sources will further enhance the performance for gene function prediction, as is done in STRING [253],  GeneMANIA [254] and Mitocarta [190, 255].",

  "answer": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has several potential applications in improving the annotation and interpretation of gene networks:  1. **Inference of Gene Functions**: AI techniques, such as network inference algorithms, can help infer the putative functions of unknown genes by linking them to genes with known functions that exhibit similar expression patterns. This approach can also prioritize candidate variants and predict disease inheritance modes to some extent [3].  2. **Network Inference Techniques**: AI-driven network inference techniques can be utilized to infer biological processes and the potential phenotypic impact of variants in genes of unknown function. These techniques can provide powerful approaches to inferring phenotypic information where direct links to phenotype do not exist [4].  3. **Computational Approaches**: AI, particularly through computational approaches using statistical, machine learning, or soft-computing techniques, serves as a discovery tool for finding gene networks. These approaches can complement literature-based methods that gather published information on genes and their interrelationships [6].  4. **Pattern Recognition and Predictive Modeling**: Deep learning models, a subset of AI, can be used for pattern recognition in gene sequences to identify potential future illnesses. There is also a demand for explainable AI models that are interpretable in decision-making, which can enhance the understanding and application of genomic data [8].  These applications demonstrate how AI can significantly enhance the annotation and interpretation of gene networks by providing insights into gene functions, biological processes, and potential phenotypic impacts.",
