    "Background There is a marked heterogeneity in human lifespan and health outcomes for people of the same chronological age. Thus, one fundamental challenge is to identify mo- lecular and cellular biomarkers of aging that could pre- dict lifespan and be useful in evaluating lifestyle changes and therapeutic strategies in the pursuit of healthy aging.

    "Background Ageing is a major risk for diseases and mortality [ 1,2]. Chronological age has been widely used as a marker of ageing due to ease and accuracy of measurement [ 1]. However, it is not necessarily a good predictor of biological ageing since individuals with the same chronological age can vary in health, especially in later life [ 3]. Therefore, researchers have attempted to search for biomarkers of ageing that can predict functional cap- ability at a later age [ 4,5]. In 2013, Hannum et al. and",

There are additional considerations when choosing biomarkers to characterize aging. First, biomarkers measured at a given age are merely snapshots of important regulatory systems (Seeman et al. 2004 ); there is no information on system dynamics if each biomarker is measured only once.

  "answer": "Advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence significantly aid in the identification of biomarkers for biological aging by enabling the development of predictive models and personalized medical treatments. These technologies allow for the integration and analysis of complex biological data, which can be used to forecast an individual's lifespan and potential age-related diseases, thereby facilitating personalized medical interventions [2]. Machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression and its variants, are employed to select aging-related biomarkers and construct aging clocks, which are predictors of chronological and biological age based on various omics datasets [3]. Additionally, computational methods have been developed to predict biological age from gene expression data, which can help in evaluating lifestyle changes and therapeutic strategies aimed at promoting healthy aging [8].",
