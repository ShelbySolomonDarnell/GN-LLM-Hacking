    "[87] and the accumulation of senescent cells in human tissues with age has been implicated as a driver of aging- related diseases. Indeed, pharmacological approaches targeting senescent cells, like senolytics, are a major and timely area of research that could result in human clin- ical applications [ 5,88]. It is imperative that we fully understand and deconstruct cellular senescence in order to target aging-related diseases. We hope that CellAge will help researchers understand the role that CS plays",
    "An important source of inflammatory signals in aged organ- isms is thought to be the accumulation of senescent cells across tissues [ 5,7]. Indeed, accumulating evidence has shown that senescent cells are characterized by a senescence-associatedsecretory phenotype [ 810], which includes a panoply of pro-inflammatory cytokines, proteases, growth factors and metabolites [ 10,11]. The impact of senescent cells on age-related inflammation, and their potential role as a target for pro-",

SASP factors exert their functions in either an autocrine or a  paracrine manner and are responsible for the induction of the chronic inflammation  and cell proliferation that contributes to cell dysfunction and cancer. Thus, the accu- mulation of senescent cells in tissue is closely associated with aging-related dis- eases.

Senescent cells induce autocrine, as well as paracrine, signaling by secretion of proinamma-",
    "senescence can deplete both stem (5153) and stromal (10,11) cell pools. Moreover, because senescent cellspersist, they have the ability to alter the tissue micro-environment, and can therefore also promote the degen-eration of organs and stem cell niches (14,46). Finally, senescent cells secrete factors such as matrix metallopro- teinase-3 (MMP-3), which favors extra-cellular matrixremodeling, promotes defects in epithelial cell dierentia-tion and stimulates cancer cell growth (46,54,55).",
    "potential role of senescence in in vivo  aging and disease has been difficult to assess and somewhat controversial   [146]. However, recent studies have shown that senescent cells accumulate in normal arterial tissue over the  lifespan of humans  [147, 148]. Likewise, the accumulation of senescent cells has been reported in diseased  tissues, such as atherosclerotic plaques  [149] and abdominal aortic aneurysms  [150]. Baker et al.  showed that",

  "answer": "Senescent cells are cells that have stopped dividing and have entered a state of permanent growth arrest. They are characterized by an altered metabolism and the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors, a phenomenon known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) [1], [3]. These cells accumulate in tissues over time and are resistant to apoptosis, meaning they are not easily cleared from the body [9].  Senescent cells contribute to aging and age-related diseases in several ways. They impact the tissue environment by secreting inflammatory cytokines, proteases, and growth factors, which can lead to chronic inflammation and tissue dysfunction [3], [4]. This chronic inflammation is a significant factor in the development of age-related degenerative diseases [1], [4]. Additionally, senescent cells can alter the tissue microenvironment, promoting the degeneration of organs and stem cell niches, and potentially stimulating cancer cell growth [6].  The accumulation of senescent cells is associated with various age-related pathologies, such as atherosclerosis, osteoarthritis, and Alzheimer's disease [5], [9]. Recent studies have shown that clearing senescent cells can prevent or delay tissue dysfunction and extend health span, highlighting their causative role in aging [5].",
