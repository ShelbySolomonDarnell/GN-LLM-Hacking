    "(Edghill et al., 2008; Garin et al., 2010; Stoy et al., 2007). Hyperglycemia occurs due to decreased insulin biosynthe-sis, in which most of the reported missense heterozygous mutations are expected to cause an abnormal proinsulin folding. An accumulation of the misfolded protein in the en-doplasmic reticulum (ER) consequently occurs, resulting in ER stress and betacell apoptosis (Liu, Hodish, Rhodes, & Arvan, 2007). Our identified de novo novel variant in INS is expected to result in aberrant proinsulin"

  "answer": "Genetic mutations in the insulin gene can significantly affect glucose metabolism in several ways:  1. Mutations that result in mutant insulin or the inability to convert proinsulin to insulin can lead to glucose intolerance. This is because the proper conversion and function of insulin are crucial for maintaining normal glucose levels in the blood [1].  2. Insulin gene mutations can cause early-onset diabetes, with marked differences in clinical presentation and metabolic status. These mutations can lead to the retention of insulin in the endoplasmic reticulum, causing stress and potentially leading to beta-cell apoptosis, which reduces insulin production and secretion [2], [10].  3. Insulin-deficient conditions, such as those caused by certain mutations, can lead to severe hyperglycemia, as insulin is a central hormone for maintaining glucose homeostasis. Without sufficient insulin, glucose cannot be effectively taken up by cells, leading to elevated blood glucose levels [5].  4. Some mutations may result in abnormal proinsulin folding, leading to an accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. This accumulation can cause endoplasmic reticulum stress and beta-cell apoptosis, further impairing insulin production and secretion [10].  Overall, genetic mutations in the insulin gene can disrupt normal insulin synthesis and function, leading to impaired glucose metabolism and conditions such as diabetes.",
