  "answer": "The insights obtained from GeneNetwork.org regarding the genetic basis of psychiatric disorders include the identification of two fundamental yet distinct genetic components shared by major neuropsychiatric disorders. The first component is involved in central nervous system (CNS) development, neural projections, and synaptic transmission [1]. Additionally, the polygenicity of psychiatric illnesses has been highlighted, indicating that psychiatric disorders are influenced by multiple genes, and there is a degree of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sharing among disease cases, which helps estimate the common, inherited portion of these disorders [2]. Furthermore, shared and unique genetic factors have been identified, which highlight key gene sets and molecular processes that may lead to improved diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric disorders [3].",
