  "answer": "Scientists use GeneNetwork.org to study differences in gene expression by leveraging a variety of analytical tools and datasets available on the platform. GeneNetwork provides access to large published phenotype and genome datasets from several species, allowing for exploratory and statistical analysis [2]. The platform includes microarray data of gene expression in the brain and other phenotypes, which can be used to compare traits across different datasets [1].   GeneNetwork also facilitates the comparison of gene expression patterns with drug responses and other phenotypic data, making it practical for identifying candidate genes for complex traits through QTL analyses [2], [4]. The platform supports correlation and network analysis to compare associations between tissues and across rodent or human datasets, which is useful for systems genetics mapping [5].   Additionally, bioinformatic analyses on GeneNetwork.org include tools for gene ontology, presence of cis-regulation or polymorphisms, phenotype correlations, and principal component analyses, which help in evaluating differentially expressed genes and understanding distinct biological processes [10].",
