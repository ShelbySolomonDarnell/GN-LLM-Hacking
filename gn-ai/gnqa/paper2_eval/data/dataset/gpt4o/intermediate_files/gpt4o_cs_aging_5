    "Exceptional Longevity One approach to identifying genes associated with low mortality is to examine the genes of those who survive to the oldest ages.  Several studieshave examined gene frequencies among centenarians or nonagenariansand compared them with frequencies at younger ages.  Since changes ingene frequencies are more rapid when mortality rates are high, cross-sectional comparisons must be adjusted for differences in mortality amongcohorts.",

Although similar aging processes are likely to operateacross multiple species [30], it has been much more diffi-cult to identify longevity candidate genes in human studies[30]. A key question in human aging is to what extent asignature of aging may be detectable across tissues. Until now there has been a lack of large transcriptional profiles from the same human individuals in multiple tissues. TheMuTHER study provides ins ight into the human aging",

  "answer": "Yes, specific genes have been linked to longer lifespans. Research has identified more than 700 genes that regulate lifespan in model organisms, with many of these genes and their associated pathways, such as the insulin/IGF1/GH pathway, shown to affect longevity across different model organisms [2]. Additionally, variants near genes such as CHRNA3/5 and APOE have been found to have age- and sex-related effects on human lifespan [7]. Genome-wide association studies have also identified loci associated with exceptional human longevity [10].",
  "question": "Are there specific genes that have been linked to longer lifespans?"
