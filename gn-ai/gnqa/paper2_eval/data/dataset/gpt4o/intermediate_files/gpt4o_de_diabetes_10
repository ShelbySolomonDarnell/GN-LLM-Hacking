  "answer": "Recent studies on the interaction between genetic variants and environmental factors in diabetes development have identified several potential therapeutic targets. These include:  1. **Primary Regulators of Insulin Secretion and Action**: Several type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk variants have been identified as primary regulators of insulin secretion, insulin action, and pancreatic islet transcription factors. This suggests that targeting these pathways could be a potential therapeutic strategy [6].  2. **Specific Genetic Variants**: Newly discovered single nucleotide variants (SNVs) allow for better characterization of abnormalities in early insulin processing and secretion. Genes such as TCF7L2, SLC30A8, and C2CD4B have been highlighted as potential targets due to their roles in these processes [6].  3. **Gene-Environment Interactions**: The interaction between genetic susceptibility and environmental factors such as physical activity and dietary fat has been shown to modify the risk of glucose homeostasis and T2D. This indicates that interventions targeting these environmental factors could potentially mitigate the genetic risk [7].  These findings underscore the importance of considering both genetic and environmental factors in developing therapeutic strategies for diabetes.",
