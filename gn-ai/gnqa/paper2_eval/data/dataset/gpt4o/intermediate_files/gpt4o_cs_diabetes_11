  "answer": "The genes most commonly associated with an increased risk of developing diabetes, particularly type 2 diabetes, include:  1. **CDKAL1, CDKN2A, CDKN2B** - These genes are linked to reduced insulin secretion via reduced beta-cell mass [1]. 2. **MTNR1B, TCF7L2, KCNJ11** - These genes are associated with beta-cell dysfunction [1]. 3. **FTO** - This gene is related to increased insulin resistance associated with obesity [1]. 4. **IRS1, PPARG** - These genes are related to increased insulin resistance unrelated to obesity [1]. 5. **IGF2BP2, HHEX, SLC30A8, WFS1** - These genes have been shown to increase susceptibility to type 2 diabetes in reproducible studies [3]. 6. **JAZF1, CDC123/CAMK1D, TSPAN8/LGR5, THADA, ADAMTS9, NOTCH2** - These are additional variants identified in a recent meta-analysis as being associated with type 2 diabetes [3]. 7. **KCNQ1** - This gene is associated with susceptibility to type 2 diabetes in East Asian and European populations [6].
