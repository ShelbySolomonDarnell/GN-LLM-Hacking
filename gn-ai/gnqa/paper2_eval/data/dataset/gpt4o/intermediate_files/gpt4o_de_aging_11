  "answer": "Age-dependent changes in the immune system, such as immunosenescence, contribute to increased susceptibility to diseases through several mechanisms:  1. **Functional Decline of the Adaptive Immune System**: Immunosenescence is characterized by a decline in the adaptive immune system's function, which leads to reduced protection against infections and decreased effectiveness of vaccinations [1]. This decline is primarily due to changes in T and B lymphocytes, which are crucial for adaptive immunity [2].  2. **Loss of Diversity in Immune Receptors**: There is a loss of diversity in the T-cell receptor (TCR) and B-cell receptor repertoire as people age. This is due to the accumulation of dysfunctional cells and decreased output from the thymus and bone marrow, which are essential for generating new immune cells [9]. This loss of diversity impairs the immune system's ability to recognize and respond to new pathogens effectively.  3. **Chronic Inflammation (Inflammaging)**: Aging is also associated with a state of low-grade chronic inflammation, known as inflammaging. This chronic inflammation can further compromise immune function and contribute to the development of age-related diseases [1], [4].  4. **Overall Immune System Alterations**: All components of the immune system are affected by aging, not just the adaptive immune system. This widespread alteration can lead to a compromised defense against pathogens, making the elderly more susceptible to infectious diseases and less responsive to vaccinations [2], [9].  These changes collectively lead to an increased susceptibility to diseases in the elderly, highlighting the importance of understanding and potentially intervening in these age-related immune alterations to improve health outcomes in older populations.",
