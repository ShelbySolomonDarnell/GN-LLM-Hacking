  "answer": "Scientists study the genetics of aging in animals using a variety of approaches and model organisms. Here are some key methods and models mentioned in the context:  1. **Animal Model Systems**: Rodents, such as rats and mice, are indispensable for molecular biological studies on aging due to their practical advantages and similarities in aging processes to humans [1].   2. **Tissue-Specific Studies**: Recent genomic studies have been performed on specialized mammalian tissues, both post-mitotic (e.g., heart, nervous system) and mitotic (e.g., liver), to understand the tissue-specific effects of aging. These studies also explore how caloric restriction affects age-related transcriptional changes, which are tissue- or species-specific [2].  3. **Laboratory Models**: Common laboratory models for studying aging include Caenorhabditis elegans (nematode worm) and Mus musculus (mice), which have shorter lifespans than humans, allowing for more rapid observation of aging processes [5].  4. **Transgenic Mouse Strains and Interventional Studies**: These studies have identified evolutionarily conserved pathways involved in lifespan regulation and common denominators of aging across different organisms [6].  These methods and models help scientists uncover the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying aging, providing insights that can be applied to understanding human aging and developing potential interventions.",
