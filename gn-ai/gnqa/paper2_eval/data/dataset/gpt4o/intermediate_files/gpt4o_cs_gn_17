This is a new  feature in GN that allows researchers to search for genes, mRNAs, or proteins across all of the  datasets. This will give the user data for that search term  across many different species, groups,  and types of data. Because of this, the global search bar is a good area to start ones searches if",

  "answer": "To access and use the data available on GeneNetwork.org, you can follow these steps:  1. **Navigating to the Website**: Start by visiting the GeneNetwork website at www.genenetwork.org [8].  2. **Searching for Data**: There are two primary ways to search for data on GeneNetwork:    - Use the global search bar located at the top of the page. This feature allows you to search for genes, mRNAs, or proteins across all datasets, providing data across various species, groups, and types of data [5].    - Alternatively, you can follow the main search workflow, which involves selecting a dataset, mining it for traits of interest based on user search queries, selecting traits from the search, and placing them in a collection for further inspection and quantitative analysis [3].  3. **Analyzing Data**: Once you have selected the data, GeneNetwork provides an analytical environment where you can perform correlation analysis and linkage mapping. This environment helps identify and substantiate gene targets for further research [7].  4. **Accessing Genotype Files**: If you need genotype files, they can be accessed directly via a specific URL: http://www.genenetwork.org/webqtl/main.py?FormID=sharinginfo&GN_AccessionId=600 [2].  5. **Using Additional Resources**: The banner menu on the main search page contains additional search options and helpful resources to assist with your analyses [3].  By following these steps, you can effectively access and utilize the data available on GeneNetwork.org for your research needs.",
