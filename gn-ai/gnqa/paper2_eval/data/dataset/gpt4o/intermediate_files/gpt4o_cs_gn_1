  "answer": "GeneNetwork.org is a web service for systems genetics that started in 2001 as WebQTL, an online version of Ken Manly's Map Manager QT program [3]. It serves as a depository of datasets and tools for use in complex systems biology approaches to generate or predict higher-order gene function [8]. GeneNetwork.org is an open-access database that collates genomic information from diverse experimental crosses and reference panels, as well as phenotypic data from various research groups [9].  GeneNetwork.org helps scientists understand genetics by providing a platform for systems genetics, which involves the study of complex traits through the integration of networks of genes, transcripts, and traits such as toxicity, cancer susceptibility, and behavior across several species [10]. It offers tools for correlation and mapping strategies to assess associations among multiple genes and quantitative trait loci (QTLs), making the study of complex traits widely available to the scientific community [2]. Additionally, it supports predictive medicine and systems genetics by constantly being maintained and improved with data from multiple species and multi-omics analysis [1].",
