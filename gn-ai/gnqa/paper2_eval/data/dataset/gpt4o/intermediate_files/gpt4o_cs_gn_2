    "users can take advantage of a systems genetics approach (Rosen et al., 2003, 2007). While the candidate gene approach asks which one gene mutation causes a particular disease, the systems genetics approach explores which phenotypes and diseases result from diverse sets of genetic and molecular markers (Rosen et al., 2003, 2007). The majority of data sets in GeneNetwork are collected from GRPs consisting of hundreds of diverse, inbred strains of",
    "Based on this, Goh et al. created networks using data from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) [18]database that houses lists of disease gene links.

GeneNetwork is designed primarily as a web service for exploratory and statistical analysis of large published phenotype and genome datasets, and includes data from several species (see Supplementary Discussion).

The genes associated with the selected disease are tested for enrichment against all sets of known associat ed genes for worm phenotypes. The result reveals functionally coherent , evolution- arily conserved gene networks. Alternatively, users can also start by selecting worm pheno types, which are tested against human diseases.

  "answer": "Researchers use GeneNetwork.org to study diseases by leveraging its capabilities as a bioinformatics tool for systems genetics analysis. This platform allows researchers to explore large phenotype and genome datasets from multiple species, which are essential for understanding complex biological networks and predicting molecular interactions [4], [5].   GeneNetwork.org supports a systems genetics approach, which examines how diverse sets of genetic and molecular markers contribute to phenotypes and diseases, rather than focusing on single gene mutations [2]. This approach is facilitated by the extensive data available on the platform, including gene expression patterns and drug response data, which can be compared and analyzed statistically [4].  The platform also enables correlation and network analysis, allowing researchers to compare associations between tissues and across different species, such as rodents and humans [6]. By studying networks of genes, proteins, metabolites, and other biomarkers, researchers can model genuine biological pathways, which helps in uncovering disease genes and understanding complex diseases [9].   Overall, GeneNetwork.org provides a comprehensive resource for predictive medicine and systems genetics, aiding researchers in constructing biological networks that are predictive of disease outcomes [1], [5].",
