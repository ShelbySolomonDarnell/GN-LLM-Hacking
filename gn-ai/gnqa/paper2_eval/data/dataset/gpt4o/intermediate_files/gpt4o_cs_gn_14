  "answer": "GeneNetwork.org can assist in understanding complex traits like height or intelligence through several key features:  1. **Analytical Tools and Data Sets**: GeneNetwork provides a variety of analytical tools that allow users to compare traits with numerous datasets available from other researchers. This includes microarray data of gene expression in the brain and other phenotypic data, which can be crucial for studying complex traits [1].  2. **Systems Genetics Approach**: The platform offers a systems genetics approach, which helps illuminate the relationships between different biological system levels, such as the genome, transcriptome, and phenome. This comprehensive view can provide insights into the roles of individual genes and developmental pathways involved in complex traits [2].  3. **Correlation and Genetic Linkage Mapping**: GeneNetwork allows for the establishment of associations between transcript abundance, phenotypic traits, and genotype using correlation or genetic linkage mapping functions. This can help identify genetic factors contributing to complex traits like height or intelligence [6].  4. **Data Mining and Trait Correlations**: The platform can be used to study correlations between traits and perform data mining in genomic regions containing candidates for quantitative trait genes. This feature is particularly useful for identifying genetic components of complex traits [4].  5. **Multi-Omics Analysis**: GeneNetwork has been updated to include multi-omics analysis, which integrates various types of biological data. This holistic approach can enhance the understanding of complex traits by considering multiple layers of biological information [7].  Overall, GeneNetwork.org provides a comprehensive suite of tools and data that can facilitate the exploration and understanding of complex traits like height and intelligence through a systems genetics framework.",
