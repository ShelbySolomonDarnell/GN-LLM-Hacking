  "answer": "Yes, there are specific genetic markers that can indicate a higher risk for Type 1 versus Type 2 diabetes.  For Type 1 diabetes, genome-wide association studies have identified over 50 loci associated with an increased genetic risk. Several candidate genes within these regions have been suggested or identified, although the exact molecular mechanisms by which they contribute to islet cell inflammation and beta cell destruction are not fully understood [1].  For Type 2 diabetes, specific genetic markers have also been identified. Some of the loci associated with an increased risk include TCF7L2, PPARG, FTO, KCNJ11, NOTCH2, WFS1, CDKAL1, IGF2BP2, SLC30A8, JAZF1, and HHEX [9]. Additionally, markers such as TCF7L2 and CAPN10 have been strongly associated with the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes [8].  These findings indicate that while both types of diabetes have genetic components, the specific markers and loci associated with each type differ, reflecting their distinct pathophysiological mechanisms.",
