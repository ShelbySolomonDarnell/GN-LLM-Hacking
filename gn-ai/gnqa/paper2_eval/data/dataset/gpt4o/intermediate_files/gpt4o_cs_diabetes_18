We have agents and interventions that can prevent or ameliorate diabetesthrough, for example, beneficial effects on islet function (e.g. sulfonylureas), obesity (weight loss), insulin resistance (e.g. exercise), fuel partitioning (e.g. thiazolidinediones) andmicrobiome content (metformin, possibly).

  "answer": "New gene therapies have the potential to cure or treat diabetes through several innovative approaches:  1. **Gene-Based Therapies**: Advances in understanding the biological mechanisms that maintain glucose homeostasis and the molecular defects leading to chronic hyperglycemia could lead to the development of gene-based therapies. These therapies aim to target specific genetic factors involved in diabetes, potentially offering more precise treatment options [3].  2. **In Vivo Gene Therapy**: This approach involves directly inserting a vector containing the desired gene into the patient. It is considered a promising therapeutic strategy for type 1 diabetes, although challenges remain in developing safe and effective vectors [9].  3. **Inducing Islet Neogenesis**: Gene therapy techniques, such as betacellulin gene therapy, have been shown to induce islet neogenesis in the liver and reverse diabetes in mice. This suggests that gene therapy can stimulate the body to produce insulin-producing cells, offering a potential cure for diabetes [10].  These strategies highlight the potential of gene therapies to address the underlying genetic causes of diabetes and restore normal insulin production and glucose regulation.",
