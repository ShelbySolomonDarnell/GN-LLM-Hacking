  "answer": "Yes, there are known genetic mutations that cause premature aging. Some specific genetic syndromes associated with premature aging include:  1. Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome, which is caused by mutations in the LMNA gene [4]. 2. Rothmund-Thomson syndrome and related disorders, which are associated with mutations in the RECQL4 gene [4]. 3. Ataxia-telangiectasia, which is another genetic disorder linked to premature aging [4].  Additionally, Martin (1978) listed 162 genetic syndromes in humans that exhibit some or many signs of premature aging [1]. These conditions highlight the connection between genetic mutations and premature aging.",
