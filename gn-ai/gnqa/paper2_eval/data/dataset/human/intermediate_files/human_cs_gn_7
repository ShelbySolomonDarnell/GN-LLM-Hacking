However, this clashed with the notion that centromeres very origin stems from recombination to create the repetitive array, where multiple short- and long-range recombination events may be responsible for the generation and reiteration of blocks of highly homogenized alpha-satellite DNA throughout the centromere [ 97,98].

  "answer": "Recombination in human centromeres is a complex process that is generally suppressed to maintain centromere integrity. Here are the key points about how recombination works in human centromeres:  1. **Recombination Suppression**: Centromere DNA is often referred to as being \"cold\" to recombination, meaning that it is generally refractory to the recombination processes that occur during meiosis in other parts of the genome [1].  2. **Potential Disruptions**: When recombination does occur, it can disrupt centromere integrity in several ways. For instance, crossover between sister chromatids can lead to sister chromatid exchange (SCE), which has been reported at human centromeres. Additionally, the search for homologous sequences may erroneously identify nearly identical sequences within the same chromatid, leading to inappropriate recombination events [3].  3. **Mechanisms to Suppress Recombination**: There are active mechanisms to suppress recombination at centromeres, which may involve core centromeric proteins. This suppression is crucial because recombination-dependent pathways, such as homologous recombination (HR), could otherwise exacerbate centromere rearrangements [4].  4. **Recombination in Centromere Formation**: Despite the general suppression, recombination is believed to play a role in the origin and formation of centromeres. Multiple short- and long-range recombination events may be responsible for generating and reiterating blocks of highly homogenized alpha-satellite DNA throughout the centromere [5].  5. **Recombination Outside Meiosis**: Recent analyses have shown that centromeres can undergo recombination during a single round of cell division in primary human cells, indicating that recombination at centromeres is not entirely restricted to meiosis [8].  In summary, while recombination at human centromeres is generally suppressed to maintain their structural integrity, it can occur under certain conditions and may play a role in the formation and evolution of centromeric DNA.",
