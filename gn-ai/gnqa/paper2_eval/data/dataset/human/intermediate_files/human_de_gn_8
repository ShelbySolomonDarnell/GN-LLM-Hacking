Laboratory mice and rats are the main mammalian models currently used for high-throughput genomic and behavior genetic research, and are employed primarily to explore and test gene function. This is con- sidered by some to be the great challenge facing biologists today  (Collins et al., 2007 ). Rodent models are used extensively as part of preclinical development and testing of treatments for disease in hu-",

  "answer": "You can use the Rat Genome Database (RGD) for genetic, genomics, phenotype, and disease-related data generated from rat research. The RGD is specifically mentioned as a platform for genetic and genomic research, including disease portals and phenotypic data [2], [5]. Additionally, it serves as a repository for various types of data such as QTLs, strains used as disease models, expression data, and more [5]. The database can be accessed at http://www.rgd.mcw.edu [1], [5].",
  "question": "Which database can I use for genetic, genomics, phenotype, and disease-related data generated from rat research?"
