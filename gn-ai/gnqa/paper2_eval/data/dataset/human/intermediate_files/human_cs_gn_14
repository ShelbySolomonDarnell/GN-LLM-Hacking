    "Bioinformatics All of the genetic analyses were carried out in GeneNetwork, whichis an open source bioinformatics resource for systems genetics thatexists as both a repository for genetic, genomic and phenotypicdata together with a suite of statistical programs for data analy-sis that includes mapping and evaluating QTLs, examining pheno-type/genotype correlations and building interaction networks. QTL mapping The QTL mapping module of GeneNetwork was used to identify",
    "the database is that each data collection is associated with a protocol which describes how  the data were generated. The project also provides online analysis tools to allow  identification of correlations within its data set. GeneNetwork ( http://www.genenetwork.org ), encompassing WebQTL, is a database of  genotypes and complex phenotypes ranging from gene expression to behaviour in standard  inbred strains, and six panels of mouse recombinant inbred strains including the two largest",
    "QTL/interval analysis  QTL  mapping  was conducted  using  publically  available  software   on GeneNetwork  (http://www .genenetwork .org/webqtl /main .py).  One  important  feature  of the GeneNetwork  is WebQTL , which  is the  leading  GeneNetwork  module , and has been  optimized  for on-line  analysis  of traits  that are controlled  by combinations  of allelic  variants   and environmental  factors  [15]. A simple  graphical  user interface",
    "WebQTL is the primary module in the Gene- Network online resource (www.genenetwork.org),and provides a powerful environment to analyzetraits controlled by genetic variants (Chesler et al.2004; Wang et al. 2003). It includes data from manypermanent genetic reference populations, including the HXB rat strains, and allows for phenotypic traits,",
    "67. As described above, loci are identified in GeneNet work by the computation of a  likelihood ratio statistic score and significance  was determined using at least 5,000  permutations of the phenotype data.   Updated QTL mapping methods , such as  R/qtl 2 66,146, Multiple QTL mapping  64,  GEMMA  156 and pyLMM  63, have been implimented on t he GeneNetwork2 site 46.",

Once the resulting record set of the query is returned, it can be further restricted by selecting relevant records based on attached annotations before for- warding it for further analysis. To map genetic loci associated with mRNA abundance or trait phenotypes, any one of the three QTL mapping func- tions currently employed by GeneNetwork's WebQTL module can be used. These are 1. interval mapping, 2. sin- gle-marker regression, or 3. composite mapping [29,30]."

  "answer": "For QTL mapping analysis in GeneNetwork2, datasets that are useful include genotypes and complex phenotypes ranging from gene expression to behavior in standard inbred strains and panels of mouse recombinant inbred strains [3]. Additionally, data from permanent genetic reference populations, such as the HXB rat strains, are also valuable [5]. These datasets allow for the identification of correlations within the data and the mapping of genetic loci associated with mRNA abundance or trait phenotypes [10].",
  "question": "what type of dataset is useful for qtl mapping analysis in genenetwork2?"
