  "answer": "Several genes have been associated with aging. Here are some key points from the provided context:  1. **Genes in Model Organisms**: A list of genes strongly associated with aging in model organisms includes those involved in segmental progeroid syndromes, such as the Werner syndrome gene, and genes critical in pathways previously related to aging, such as the insulin/insulin-like signaling pathway [1].  2. **Gene Expression Analysis**: Studies have identified genes overexpressed with age that have protective functions, suggesting they help manage aging and could be targets for manipulation. Gene expression analysis of caloric restriction (CR) has also been conducted to identify associated genes [2].  3. **Human Longevity-Associated Genes**: Dozens of genes have been associated with human longevity, although only a handful have shown consistent effects across populations [4].  4. **GenAge Data Set**: A curated list of human genes associated with aging in different model systems is available from the GenAge data set [6].  5. **GenAge Online Database**: Genes with established aging-related functions were identified by interrogation of the GenAge online database, aging-associated Gene Ontology groups, and hand annotation [9].  These references collectively highlight the involvement of various genes and pathways in the aging process.",
