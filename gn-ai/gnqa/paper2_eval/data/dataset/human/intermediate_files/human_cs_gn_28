    "In sexually reproducing organisms, body cells contain 2 sets of chromosomes (1 set from each parent). To maintain this state, the egg and sperm that unite during fertilization each contain a single set of chromosomes. During meiosis, diploid cells undergo DNA replication, followed by 2 rounds of  cell division, producing 4 gametes, each of which has 1 set  of chromosomes (for humans, 23 unpaired chromosomes). Recombination occurs during meiosis. Mendelian diseaseSame as monogenic disease. Named",

Sex Chromosomes   Several studies have revealed high degrees of  homology among autosomal chromosomes of bovids with similar banding patterns and gene order among the chromosome arms of ca ttle, river buffalo, sheep,  and goats [14, 15].
