  "answer": "Ensembl is a comprehensive genomic database that identifies the positions of known human genes from public sequence database entries, often using tools like GENEWISE to predict their exon structures. It aims to provide a more accurate reflection of reality compared to ab initio predictions alone [1]. Additionally, Ensembl includes various genomic features such as different repeat classes, cytological bands, CpG island predictions, tRNA gene predictions, and expressed sequence clusters from the UniGene database [7]. It also reflects the progress of projects like the International Haplotype Map Project and allows users to view speculative data and develop personalized annotations [4].",
