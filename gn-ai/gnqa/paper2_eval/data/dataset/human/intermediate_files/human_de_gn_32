These traits contribute to normal variation in human behavior. Yet, these trait variants also increase the susceptibility of a disorder or a condition for many others.",

Selection and Saving Multiple Traits The list of traits on the Correlation Results page represents traits that may be related in some way. You may want to select a group of them for further analysis.

  "answer": "The different relationships between traits can be categorized into several types based on the provided context:  1. **Correlation Among Traits in a Pair**: This refers to how traits within a pair are related to each other in terms of their correlation [1], [2], [3].  2. **Correlation Between a Trait Pair and Other Factors**: This involves examining how a pair of traits correlates with other external factors or conditions [1], [2], [3].  3. **High-Order Organization of Traits**:    - **Groups of Tightly Related Traits**: These are traits that share the same transcript mechanisms and are highly correlated with each other (modules 1, 2, 6, 7, 8) [6], [7], [8].    - **Groups of Distinct Traits with Shared Mechanisms**: These traits share the same transcript mechanisms but do not necessarily have high correlations among themselves (modules 3, 4, 5) [6], [7], [8].    - **Overlapping Traits in Different Groups**: Different groups of traits may have overlapping traits but typically differ in their underlying mechanisms [6], [7], [8].  These relationships highlight the complexity and interconnectedness of traits, showing that they can be related through direct correlations, shared mechanisms, or overlapping characteristics.",
