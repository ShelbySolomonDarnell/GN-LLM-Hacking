  "answer": "GeneNetwork can assist in identifying genetic factors involved in diabetes by leveraging large-scale genetic studies and databases that focus on genetic susceptibility factors. For instance, the Diabetes (GoKinD) study provides a genetics collection specifically aimed at identifying genetic susceptibility factors for diabetic nephropathy in type 1 diabetes [2], [4]. Additionally, advances in genotyping technology have facilitated rapid progress in large-scale genetic studies, enabling the identification of numerous novel genetic variants that increase susceptibility to diabetes and related traits [5]. These resources and technological advancements can be utilized within GeneNetwork to analyze genetic data and identify potential genetic factors involved in diabetes.",
