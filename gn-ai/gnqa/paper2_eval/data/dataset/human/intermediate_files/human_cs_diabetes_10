Individuals at increased risk of  developing this type of diabetes can often be identified by serological  evidence of an autoimmune process of the pancreatic islets and by genetic  markers.

    "Diabetes is a disorder of carbohydrate metabolism charac-terized primarily by hyperglycemia resulting from ineffec-tive uptake of glucose by tissues. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that typically occurs early in life and results in total loss of insulin production, whereas type 2 diabetes develops over time as tissues develop a resistance to insulin, and insulin release from the pancreas slowly diminishes. As carbohydrates have the greatest effect on blood glucose of all macronutrients, their",

    "Diabetes mellitus comprises a heterogenous group of disorders that have been classified as either insulin-dependent (IDDM) or non-insulin-depend- ent (NIDDM).1 Their causes are poorly understood but appear to involve some form of interaction between ge- netic and environmental factors.2-4 Some of the environmen- tal factors that can contribute to IDDM include viral infections and chemicals, while obesity is a common predisposing fac- tor for NIDDM.

  "answer": "Diabetes can be caused by different factors depending on the type.   1. **Type 1 Diabetes**: This type is primarily caused by an absolute deficiency of insulin secretion due to an autoimmune process that destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreatic islets [1], [5]. Genetic markers and serological evidence can often identify individuals at increased risk [1].  2. **Type 2 Diabetes**: This type is caused by a combination of resistance to insulin action and an inadequate compensatory insulin secretory response [1]. It develops over time as tissues become resistant to insulin, and the pancreas's ability to release insulin diminishes [3]. Obesity is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes, with both genetic and environmental factors playing a role [8].  3. **General Factors**: Both types of diabetes ultimately lead to pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction [2]. Environmental factors, such as viral infections and chemicals, can contribute to the development of diabetes, particularly type 1, while obesity is a common predisposing factor for type 2 diabetes [10].  In summary, diabetes is caused by a combination of genetic, autoimmune, and environmental factors that affect insulin production and action [1], [3], [8], [10].",
