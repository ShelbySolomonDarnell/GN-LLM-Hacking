He and others  considered that hormones released by stressful experiences could  enhance memory consolidation, indicating particularly the hormones  epinephrine and glucocorticoids as memory modulators (McGaugh &",
    "For example, stress is a functional state of psychosocial arousal that focuses and energizes us to confront the stressor, but chronic/toxic levels of stress lead to disruptive changes in brain architecture and dysregulation of stress response mechanisms, such as the hypothalamus-pituitary ( hpA) axis and the autonomic  nervous (ANS) system. Under chronic stress, the adrenal glands of mammals (including humans) release the steroid hormone cortisol. Cortisol acts by increas -",

  "answer": "During stressful experiences, our brains release several hormones, including corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and glucocorticoids (GC) [1]. Additionally, cortisol, a steroid hormone, is released by the adrenal glands under chronic stress [6]. These hormones play significant roles in regulating immune responses, neuronal survival, neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and behavioral responses [1].",
  "question": "what hormones do our brains release during stressful experiences?"
