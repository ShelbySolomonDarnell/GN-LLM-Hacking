Genes inducing cellular senescence tend to be overexpressed with age in human tissues and are significantly overrepresented in anti-longevity and tumor-suppressor genes, while genes inhibiting cellular senescence overlap with pro-longevity and oncogenes.

  "answer": "Several genes are involved in the aging process, as identified in various studies:  1. **APOE**: This gene is involved in lipoprotein metabolism and is critically related to longevity [4]. 2. **Superoxide dismutase**: A free-radical scavenger gene that has been shown to increase lifespan in model organisms [8]. 3. **Methuselah**: A potential G protein-coupled receptor gene in *Drosophila melanogaster* associated with increased lifespan [8]. 4. **p66shc**: An oxidative stress-response gene involved in aging [8]. 5. **Insulin/IGF1/GH pathway genes**: These genes are part of a pathway that affects longevity across different model organisms [5]. 6. **Genes involved in DNA repair and chromatin remodeling**: These genes are down-regulated during aging [7]. 7. **Genes associated with cellular senescence**: These include genes that induce or inhibit cellular senescence, which are overexpressed with age and are linked to anti-longevity and tumor-suppressor functions [2].  Additionally, studies have identified between 300 to 750 genes related to longevity that are involved in various life activities such as growth, development, energy metabolism, oxidative stress, genomic stability maintenance, and neurocognition [4].",
