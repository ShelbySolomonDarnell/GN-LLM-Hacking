It is well-known that aging is influenced by a combin- ation of genetic and environmental factors. Previous twin stud- ies have shown that the genetic contribution to general human longevity is about 2030% [ 4,5], whereas environmental factors in human aging and longevity still account for the largest effect.

  "answer": "Genetic factors play a significant role in influencing aging in humans. Here are some key points based on the provided context:  1. **Heritability of Longevity**: Human longevity shows a relatively modest heritability of less than 50% [1]. Twin studies have estimated the genetic contribution to general human longevity to be about 20-30% [10].  2. **Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS)**: Large-scale GWAS have identified numerous loci associated with age-related traits, indicating that specific genetic variations can influence aging [7].  3. **Specific Genetic Variants**: The APOE gene and its variants have been comprehensively analyzed for their association with late-onset Alzheimer's disease, which is an age-related condition [2]. This suggests that certain genetic markers are linked to age-related diseases.  4. **Epigenetic Regulation**: Epigenetic mechanisms, which involve changes in gene expression without altering the DNA sequence, also play a crucial role in aging. Environmental inputs can affect genomic stability through epigenetic regulation [4].  5. **Inheritance Studies**: Studies on the inheritance of human longevity, such as those conducted in Iceland, have provided insights into the genetic factors that contribute to a longer lifespan [5].  In summary, aging in humans is influenced by a combination of genetic factors, including specific genetic variants, heritability, and epigenetic regulation [1], [2], [4], [5], [7], [10].",
