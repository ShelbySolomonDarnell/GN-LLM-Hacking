  "answer": "Lifestyle modifications, including increased physical activity (PA) and prudent food consumption, have been shown to be effective in preventing obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) [1]. These modifications can have a sustained positive effect on diabetes risk, even independently of body weight and weight loss [1]. This suggests that the benefits of lifestyle changes extend beyond mere weight management.  Furthermore, lifestyle modifications can attenuate the negative effects on metabolic profiles, body weight, and diabetes risk, even in individuals with genetic susceptibility to T2DM [2]. This indicates that lifestyle changes can potentially eliminate the increased risk of developing T2DM in genetically predisposed individuals.  The effectiveness of lifestyle changes in reducing the rate of diabetes development has been demonstrated in prediabetic populations, where both reduced macronutrient intake and increased exercise have been shown to lower inflammation, a key factor in diabetes progression [6]. Additionally, randomized controlled trials have shown that lifestyle interventions can reduce the incidence of T2DM by approximately 60% [4].  In summary, lifestyle modifications play a crucial role in reducing the risk of aging-associated diabetes by improving metabolic health, reducing inflammation, and mitigating genetic risks, thereby offering a comprehensive approach to diabetes prevention [1], [2], [4], [6].",
