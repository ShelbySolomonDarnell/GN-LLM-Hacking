  "answer": "Our brains maintain emotions through a complex interplay of various brain regions and neural circuits. Key areas involved include:  1. **Amygdala**: Sensory inputs with emotional components are transmitted to the amygdala, where they are processed and further relayed to other regions to modulate autonomic and behavioral responses, and to form emotional memories [6]. The amygdala orchestrates responses to threats and is involved in both negative and positive emotional states [10].  2. **Prefrontal Cortex**: The ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) is critical for regulating responses to emotional stimuli. Increased activity in the right VLPFC is associated with decreased activity in the amygdala, which helps in managing negative affective states [9].  3. **Extended Limbic System**: This system, which includes structures like the hippocampus, is primitively responsible for fear and pleasure responses, stress, memory, and learning. It is modulated by immune signaling, indicating that inflammation can affect emotional regulation [2].  4. **Midbrain Structures**: These structures are involved in emotion regulation and are activated by both physical pain and pleasure, as well as positive and negative socially induced emotions [3].  5. **Nucleus Accumbens and Ventral Striatum**: These areas participate in reward responses and positive emotional states [10].  Overall, the brain maintains emotions through the coordinated activity of these regions, which process, regulate, and respond to emotional stimuli, thereby shaping our emotional experiences and behaviors.",
