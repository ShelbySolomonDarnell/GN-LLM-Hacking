These diseases generally are complex, with clear contribu-tions of genetic background and exposure to environmental stimuli (see Kleeberger & Peden 2005). It is unlikely that the increased incidence in disease can be attributed only to genetics as increases in disease-causing genetic mutations to account for the increase would require multiple generations. Therefore the role of environmental exposures",

This model proposes that compromised epithelial barriers promote sensitisation to food and airway allergens and to wheezing illnesses in early life. 46,47 In fact, childhood  onset-specific loci identified in this study have been associated with atopic dermatitis or food allergies, such as FLG on 1q21.3 with the atopic march, 41 atopic",
