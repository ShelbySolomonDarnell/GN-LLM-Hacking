Broadly defined, bioinformatics refersto the use of computers to seek patterns in the observedbiological data and to propose mechanisms for such patterns.As can be seen from below, bioinformatics not only canhelp us directly address experimental research objectives butalso can integrate information from various sources and seekspatterns not achievable through experimentation alone.",
    "Since the first protein database was created by Margaret Dayhoffin 1965 in response to the increase in protein sequencing, therehas been an explosion of data from the different modalities. Foreach of the aforementioned levels, bioinformatics plays a crucialand intimate role in each of the steps.

  "answer": "Bioinformatics broadly refers to the use of computers to seek patterns in observed biological data and to propose mechanisms for such patterns [5]. It involves methods of computer-based information processing for analyzing the structure and function of biologically important molecules [3], [4]. The field draws from the foundations of statistics, mathematics, physics, computer science, and molecular biology, reflecting a broad base of scientific specialties [8], [9], [10].",
