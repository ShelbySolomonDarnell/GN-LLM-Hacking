  "answer": "Several genes have been associated with diabetes, both type 1 and type 2, according to the provided context:  1. **Type 1 Diabetes:**    - **Insulin gene minisatellite locus (IDDM2)**: Susceptibility to type 1 diabetes is determined by tandem repeat variation at this locus [2].    - **CTLA-4 gene region of chromosome 2q33**: This gene region is linked to and associated with type 1 diabetes [4].  2. **Type 2 Diabetes:**    - **ABCC8/SUR1**: A rare mutation in this gene affects ATP-sensitive K+ channel activity and beta-cell glucose sensing, leading to type 2 diabetes [1].    - **Common gene variants**: Several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have linked common gene variants with increased risk of type 2 diabetes, including:      - **CDKAL1, CDKN2A, CDKN2B**: Associated with reduced insulin secretion via reduced beta-cell mass [3].      - **MTNR1B, TCF7L2, KCNJ11**: Associated with beta-cell dysfunction [3].      - **FTO**: Associated with increased insulin resistance related to obesity [3].      - **IRS1, PPARG**: Associated with increased insulin resistance unrelated to obesity [3].    - **Other genes**: Additional genes associated with type 2 diabetes include:      - **TCF7L2, KCNJ11, PPARG, CDKAL1, IGF2BP2, FTO, HHEX, SLC30A8, WFS1** [5].      - **JAZF1, CDC123/CAMK1D, TSPAN8/LGR5, THADA, ADAMTS9, NOTCH2** [5].    - **Genes related to beta-cell dysfunction**: Many type 2 diabetes genes appear to be related to beta-cell dysfunction [6].    - **Monogenic diabetes genes**: Genes such as **HNF1A, HNF4A, HNF1B, INS, NEUROD1, PDX1, PAX4, ABCC8, KCNJ11, KLF11, CEL, BLK** are associated with monogenic forms of diabetes [7].    - **Genes associated with recessive diseases that include diabetes**: **WFS1, NEUROG3, EIF2AK3, GLIS3, RFX6, SLC19A2** [7].    - **Genes with heterozygous mutations causing diabetes mellitus**: **PAX6, GATA6, PPARG** [7].    - **Inflammatory genes**: Genes such as **IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IL-10, IL12B, IL23R, IL23A** are associated with a greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes [9].
