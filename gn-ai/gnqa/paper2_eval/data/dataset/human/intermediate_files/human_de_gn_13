During the S phase of the cell cycle, replication starts from replication origins, and isinhibited at the replication fork barrier site (RFB) by the function of the fork blocking protein, Fob1 (Fig. 3)[12].

  "answer": "DNA replication is a critical process that ensures the accurate copying of genetic information during cell division. Here is an explanation of the process and how it maintains accuracy:  1. **Separation of DNA Strands**: During replication, the two strands of the mother cell DNA are separated [1], [2]. This separation is essential to expose the nucleotide sequences of each strand, which will serve as templates for the synthesis of new complementary strands.  2. **Formation of New Strands**: New nucleotides are assembled to form two double helices that are identical to the original DNA molecule [1], [2]. Each original strand pairs with a newly synthesized complementary strand, resulting in two DNA molecules, each consisting of one old and one new strand. This method is known as semi-conservative replication.  3. **Initiation at Replication Origins**: Replication begins at specific locations on the DNA molecule called replication origins. During the S phase of the cell cycle, replication starts from these origins [3].  4. **Replication Fork and Enzyme Activity**: The replication process involves the formation of a replication fork, where enzymes like DNA helicase unwind the DNA double helix. DNA polymerase then adds new nucleotides to the growing DNA strand by matching them with the complementary nucleotides on the template strand.  5. **Error Minimization and Repair Mechanisms**: Cells have mechanisms to monitor replication and minimize errors. For instance, cell-cycle checkpoints ensure coordination of DNA synthesis and repair with cell division [6]. Additionally, specific repair proteins can revert certain DNA injuries, ensuring the fidelity of the replication process [4].  6. **Postreplicative Repair**: If replication encounters obstacles such as DNA adducts, cells can induce DNA damage tolerance mechanisms. These mechanisms allow the completion of replication through error-free template switching using the sister chromatid or through translesion polymerases [9].  By following these steps and employing various error-checking and repair mechanisms, DNA replication ensures that genetic information is accurately copied and transmitted to daughter cells during cell division.",
