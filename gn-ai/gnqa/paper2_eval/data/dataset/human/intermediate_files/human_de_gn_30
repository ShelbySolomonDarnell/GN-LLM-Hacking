  "answer": "Using a pangenome-based reference can be more useful than using a single linear reference for several reasons:  1. **Capturing Genetic Diversity**: A single linear reference genome represents just one version of a species' DNA, which might not include all the genetic variations found in different individuals. A pangenome, on the other hand, includes multiple versions of genes and sequences from various individuals, capturing a broader spectrum of genetic diversity [3].  2. **Reducing Reference Bias**: When using a single linear reference, there's a risk of reference bias, which means that genetic variations not present in the reference genome might be missed or misinterpreted. A pangenome reduces this bias by including multiple genetic variants, making it more likely to accurately represent the genetic makeup of different individuals [1].  3. **Improving Disease Research**: By including a wider range of genetic variations, a pangenome can help researchers better understand the genetic basis of diseases. This comprehensive approach allows for more accurate identification of disease-associated genetic variants, which can lead to better diagnostics and treatments [6].  4. **Enhanced Analysis Tools**: The use of a pangenome can improve the performance of genetic analysis tools. For example, it can provide a more accurate benchmark for evaluating new sequencing technologies and analysis methods, leading to more reliable results [3].  5. **Overcoming Limitations of Single References**: A single reference genome assumes that the order and structure of genes are the same across all individuals, which is not always true. This assumption can lead to errors in genetic studies. A pangenome, by including multiple sequences, can account for these structural variations and provide a more accurate representation of the genome [2].  In summary, a pangenome-based reference is more useful because it captures the genetic diversity of a species, reduces reference bias, improves disease research, enhances analysis tools, and overcomes the limitations of using a single linear reference. This makes it a more comprehensive and accurate tool for genetic studies.",
