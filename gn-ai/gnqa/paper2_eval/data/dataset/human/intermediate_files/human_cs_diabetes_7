    "The biological processes linking aging and disease risk are poorly understood. Still, aging is considered to date as  one of the main factors responsible for several complex diseases including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes. Particularly, type 2 diabetes (T2D) has become very prevalent all over the world, with a projected increas- ing growth rate for the years ahead 1. The pathophysiological mechanism that underlines diabetic complications",

The vastmajority of AD cases are late onset and sporadic in origin withaging being the most profound risk factor. Insulin signaling isknown to be involved in the process of brain aging (1220).Insulin dysfunction/resistance in diabetes mellitus (DM) is notonly a common syndrome in the elderly but also considered a riskfactor for AD, especially for vascular dementia (21, 22).

    "COMMENT In a cohort of more than 800 older persons, we found thatdiabetes mellitus sometime in the study was associated withan increased risk of developing AD during a mean of 5.5years of observation. The risk of incident AD was 65% higherin those with diabetes mellitus than in those without it.Overall, results were similar in analyses restricted to dia-",

Insulin resist-ance increases with age, and the incidence of diabetes rises sharply in the elderly (American Diabetes Association,  2010a ).   In a few patients, genetic mutations appear to be associ- ated with T2D (Roche  et al.  ,  2005 ; American Diabetes  Association,  2010a ).

On the other hand, no difference in genetic risk is observed for type 2 diabetes genetic risk and cancer. Some of these ndings (type 2 diabetes, colon, and lung cancer) can be explained by the",

  "answer": "Yes, there is a direct association between aging and susceptibility to having diabetes. Aging is considered one of the main factors responsible for several complex diseases, including diabetes, particularly type 2 diabetes (T2D) [1]. Additionally, insulin resistance, which is a key factor in the development of diabetes, increases with age, and the incidence of diabetes rises sharply in the elderly [6].",
