    "we do not wish to dispute this viewpoint, it is interesting to note that anti- in  ammatory actions of CORT are most pronounced at high and supraphysiological  concentrations, whereas lower concentrations of CORT appear to have some  immune-potentiating effects (e.g.,  [  6  ] ). Whether these low-dose facilitation effects  relate more directly to the timing of CORT injection relative to cytokine measure- ments, or represent differential tissue sensitivity to glucocorticoids, remains to be",

While the protection afforded by this bar- rier enzyme can be overwhelmed when cortisol levels get very high, it likely functions effec- tively when cortisol remains within the normalrange (Campbell and Murphy, 1997 ). There is now considerable interest in what types of events or other hormones might lower 11-HSD2 andthereby reduce the buffering benets it affords. On example is elevated catecholamine levels,",

Acute increase of corticosterone leads to decreased cell proliferation while chronic increase causes an increase in proliferation rate (Sapolsky et al., 2000). This discrepancy is due to the presence of two receptors with different binding affinities: the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). The GR present in",

Sorrells and Sapolsky (2007 ) have provided a thought provoking recent review, contrasting the well-established anti-inammatory aspect of glucocorticoids, with the mounting evidence for their pro-inammatory effects both in the periphery and in the brain fol-lowing chronic exposure. This pattern of results demonstrates that the acute stress response has",

  "answer": "Corticosterone has several uses and effects as indicated in the provided context:  1. **Amplification of Stress-Induced Changes**: Corticosterone importantly amplifies stress-induced changes [1]. 2. **Anti-inflammatory and Immune Effects**: At high and supraphysiological concentrations, corticosterone has pronounced anti-inflammatory actions. Conversely, at lower concentrations, it appears to have some immune-potentiating effects [3]. 3. **Impact on Cell Proliferation**: Acute increases in corticosterone lead to decreased cell proliferation, while chronic increases cause an increase in proliferation rate. This is due to the presence of two receptors with different binding affinities: the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) [5]. 4. **Reduction of Delayed-Type Hypersensitivity Response**: Corticosterone dramatically reduces the delayed-type hypersensitivity response [6]. 5. **Measurement in Research**: Corticosterone levels can be measured in plasma samples using specific enzyme immunoassay kits, which is useful in various research settings [8].  These points highlight the diverse roles and applications of corticosterone in both physiological and research contexts.",
