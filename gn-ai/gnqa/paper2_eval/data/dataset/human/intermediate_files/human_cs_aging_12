  "answer": "Several genes have been associated with aging in humans according to the provided context:  1. **GenAge Data Set**: This data set includes genes that may regulate aging in humans or are considerably associated with the human aging phenotype [2]. 2. **HECW2, HIP1, BIN2, GRIA1, KCNQ4, LMO4**: These genes are highly expressed in the brain and have been previously related to the regulation of neuronal excitability and plasticity [4]. 3. **Werners Syndrome Gene**: Mutations in this gene result in segmental progeroid syndromes, which are critical in pathways previously related to aging, such as the insulin/insulin-like signaling pathway [7].  These references indicate that there are multiple genes associated with aging in humans, with some being highly expressed in specific tissues like the brain and others being involved in critical aging-related pathways.",
