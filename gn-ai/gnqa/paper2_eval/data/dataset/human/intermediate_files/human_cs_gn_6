    "to this process. This led to the assumption that centromeres do not undergo recombination and that the repetitive arrays are maintained as stable. However, this clashed with the notion that centromeres very origin stems from recombination to create the repetitive array, where multiple short- and long-range recombination events may be responsible for the generation and reiteration of blocks of highly homogenized alpha-satellite DNA throughout the centromere [ 97,98]. Furthermore, in addition",

(2) Search for  the homologous sequence may erroneously identify an  identical or nearly identical sequence within  the same chromatid downstream or upstream of the break site.

  "answer": "Recombination in human centromeres is generally suppressed, making these regions \"cold\" to recombination events [2]. This suppression is thought to be actively maintained by core centromeric proteins [3]. Despite this, there is evidence suggesting that centromeres can undergo recombination, particularly through mechanisms that involve homologous recombination (HR) during DNA repair processes [6]. For instance, crossover between sister chromatids, known as sister chromatid exchange (SCE), has been reported at human centromeres [6]. Additionally, centromeres may experience recombination during a single round of cell division in primary human cells [8]. This indicates that while recombination is generally suppressed in centromeres, it can still occur under certain conditions, potentially impacting centromere integrity and stability [5], [6], [8].",
