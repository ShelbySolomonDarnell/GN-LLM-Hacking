  "answer": "Once a sperm combines with an egg, the traits passed on to the resulting lifeform are determined by several factors:  1. **Genetic Information**: The fertilized egg, or zygote, contains a full complement of 23 chromosome pairs, which includes a mix of genetic material from both the maternal and paternal chromosomes [7]. This genetic information is coded in DNA molecules and is heritable [4].  2. **Gene Activation and Regulation**: The process of trait determination involves controlling which genes are active, when they activate, and for how long they remain active. This control can be achieved through several mechanisms:    - **Imprinting**: Genes can be marked with small chemical tags that flag them to be activated or remain inactive, depending on whether the modification was made by the father (in the sperm) or the mother (in the egg) [2], [3].    - **Maternal Effect**: The mother can alter gene activity in her offspring via the placenta [3].    - **Cis-Regulation**: Instructions encoded within the embryo's DNA can directly control if and when a nearby gene becomes activated [3].  3. **Epigenetic Marks**: Soon after fertilization, male and female cells have sex-specific transcriptomes, epigenomes, and phenotypes. Epigenetic marks, which are less constrained, can be maintained and affect gene expression and phenotype later in development [5].  4. **Mutations and Environmental Factors**: Gene mutations caused by factors such as radiation and chemicals can also be passed on to offspring if they occur in sex cells [4]. Additionally, environmental conditions experienced by the parents can influence the traits of the offspring through epigenetic mechanisms [10].  These combined factors ensure that the resulting lifeform inherits a unique set of traits from both parents, influenced by genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors.",
