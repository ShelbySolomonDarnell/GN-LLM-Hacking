Separate work that examined liver gene  expression in a smaller cohort of human samples with and without Type I diabetes found  that ERBB3  did not have a cis -eQTL but that a flanking gene, R PS26, did.  Since the disease  phenotype and RPS26  both had QTLs in the same location, this suggested the RPS26  was a  stronger candidate than ERBB3 .

  "answer": "Yes, the genes SH2B3, IFIH1, and ERBB3 are related to diabetes:  1. **IFIH1**: Rare variants of IFIH1, a gene implicated in antiviral responses, protect against type 1 diabetes [1], [3], [5], [6].  2. **ERBB3**: ERBB3 is considered to be a major feature of type 1 diabetes susceptibility due to its role in immune signaling [4]. Additionally, a genome-wide association study proposed ERBB3 as the best candidate gene near a QTL for type 1 diabetes [8].  3. **SH2B3**: SH2B3 (also known as LNK) is considered to be a major feature of type 1 diabetes susceptibility due to its role in immune signaling [4].  Thus, all three genes, SH2B3, IFIH1, and ERBB3, are related to diabetes.",
  "question": "Is any of the genes SH2B3, IFIH1 or ERBB3 related to diabetes?"
