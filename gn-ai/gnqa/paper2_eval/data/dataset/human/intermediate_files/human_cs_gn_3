  "answer": "Genetics is the study of individual genes and their protein products [2]. It involves understanding how genes are inherited, how they function, and how they influence traits and conditions passed down from one generation to another [6]. This field also includes the analysis of genetic linkage data for Mendelian traits [3].",
