    "a fertilized egg is a complicated process that relies on controlling: which genes are active; whenthese genes activate; and for how long they are active. In broad terms, there are four ways that thiscontrol can be achieved: First, inside the sperm or egg, genes can be marked with small chemical tags that flag these genes",

  "answer": "Once a sperm combines with an egg, the traits passed onto the resulting lifeform are determined by several factors:  1. **Chromosomal Segments**: Individuals inherit a patchwork of chromosomal segments from maternal and paternal chromosomes due to phenomena such as mutations and gene conversion events during meiosis [1].  2. **Mendelian Laws**: The Mendel laws of segregation and independent assortment play a crucial role. The law of segregation states that each parent passes a randomly selected allele for a given trait to their offspring [4].  3. **Gene Activation and Regulation**: The process of trait determination also involves controlling which genes are active, when they activate, and for how long. This control can be achieved through mechanisms such as imprinting, maternal effect, and cis-regulation [3], [5].  4. **Epigenetic Marks**: Epigenetic marks, which are chemical modifications to DNA that do not change the DNA sequence but affect gene expression, also play a role. These marks can be inherited and influence gene expression and phenotype later in development [8].  5. **Heritable Material**: The information passed from parents to offspring is coded in DNA molecules, and any mutations in these genes can be inherited by the offspring [7].  In summary, the combination of chromosomal inheritance, Mendelian genetic laws, gene activation and regulation mechanisms, epigenetic marks, and the heritable DNA material all contribute to how traits are passed onto the resulting lifeform after fertilization.",
