    "populations as Ensembl reects the progress of the International Haplotype Map Project (Thorisson et al. , 2005). More speculative data, such as GENSCAN-predicted exons that have not been incorporated into Ensembl-conrmed genes, may also be viewed. This means that the display can be used as a workbench for the user to develop personalized an- notation. For example, one may discover novel exons by nding GENSCAN exon predictions which coincide with good matches to a fragment of the draft mouse"

  "answer": "Ensembl is a genomic database that identifies the positions of known human genes from public sequence database entries, usually using tools like GENEWISE to predict their exon structures. It aims to provide a more accurate reflection of reality compared to ab initio predictions alone [1]. Ensembl also includes many genomic features other than predicted genes, such as different repeat classes, cytological bands, CpG island predictions, tRNA gene predictions, and expressed sequence clusters from the UniGene database [4].",
