    "of complex traits. It has been said that The brain is the chief architect,  orchestrator and driver of behavior; behavior, in turn, is the principal function of  the brain (Gomez -Marin et al., 2014, p. 1455) , and therefore to understand one  we need to understand the other. The brain and the behaviours that it causes are  highly complex traits influen ced by many factors including genes (Hager et al.,  2012; Hitzemann et al., 2013; McCarroll and Hyman, 2013) , environment (Carola"

  "answer": "The proper functioning of the brain is ensured by several factors:  1. **Precise Regulation of Molecular and Cellular Events**: The development of the brain is a highly complex process that relies on the precise regulation of molecular and cellular events, which are grounded in the spatiotemporal regulation of transcription [3].  2. **Energy Metabolism**: Energy metabolism plays a crucial role in the fate of adult neural stem cells, which is essential for maintaining brain function [8].  3. **Functional Reserve and Resiliency**: The creation of redundancy in brain circuitry is associated with functional reserve and resiliency, which are critical for maintaining homeostatic equilibrium and supporting healthy aging and longevity [9].  These factors collectively ensure that the brain works effectively.",
