    "age-related decline results from damaging by-products of metabolism and/or inefficient repairmechanisms (27, 32). According to this view, dam-agewhich can take on many formsaccumu-lates throughout the life span (38). The exponentialincrease in mortality and the functional declinethat characterize aging, however, only begin aftersexual maturity, whether this occurs at age 13, as inhumans, age 5, as in monkeys, or at less than 2months, as in mice. Therefore, one alternative viewis that aging is perhaps",
    "of a pro-cess of mutation accumulation in somatic cells. While im-plicated as a general cause of aging, no specic mecha-nism has been proposed as to how mutation accumulationcould ever lead to the multitude of degenerative processesthat comprise aging. We have now demonstrated that alarge variety of mutations accumulate with age at greatlydifferent rates in a tissue-specic manner. More recentlywe have shown that while some organs, such as brain, donot seem to accumulate mutations with age at all,",

Finally, the wear-and-tear theory poses that the cumulative damage that  eventually leads to ageing and death is, in fact, the result of the continuous function- ing of vital processes, during which stochastic errors gradually arise.",
    "Many mechanistic theories of aging argue that",
    "cell senescence and cell death pathways, are a major cause of aging pheno-types, such as organ atrophy. This would appear to be a pre-programmed cause of aging, since it is a consistent response of a sizable fraction of the cell population. However, cellular responses to damage are unlikely to be the onlyexplanation for aging, since even very old organisms still appear to have am-ple tissue capacity left to function optimally.",
    "function during aging.",
    "INTRODUCTION    The aging process represents progressive changes in a  cell or an organism which culminate in death due to accumulated defects in function leading to system failure [1].  These defe cts result in part from  accumulated damage to DNA.  Such damage may result      www.impactaging.com AGING, January 2009, Vol. 1. No 1  Review",
    "that induce complex molecular changes and, in turn, a deterioration of cellular structures and function. These changes are major causes of age-related diseases like cancer or cardiovascular disorders [1, 2]. The main mo- lecular adaptations occurring during aging are loss ofgenomic stability due to reduced DNA repair capacities [3], loss of proliferative potential caused by increased senescence [1, 4], and age-related alterations in the DNA-methylation patterns that affect cellular plasticity",

Since  aging comprises the greatest risk factor for a variety of chronic diseases, includ- ing cancer, cardiovascular disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases [2], one of the  goals of biomedical research is to decipher the molecular mechanism underlying  aging, which in turn might facilitate the development of treatments aimed at delay-"

  "answer": "The aging process is caused by several factors, including:  1. **Accumulated Damage**: Age-related decline results from damaging by-products of metabolism and/or inefficient repair mechanisms, leading to damage that accumulates throughout the lifespan [2]. 2. **Mutation Accumulation**: A process of mutation accumulation in somatic cells, although no specific mechanism has been proposed for how this leads to the multitude of degenerative processes that comprise aging [3]. 3. **Free Radicals and Oxidative Stress**: The theory of free radicals suggests that aging results from inadequate protection against cell and tissue damage by free radicals and oxidative stress throughout life [4]. 4. **Wear-and-Tear**: The wear-and-tear theory posits that cumulative damage from the continuous functioning of vital processes leads to aging and death due to stochastic errors gradually arising [4]. 5. **Cell Senescence and Death Pathways**: Cell senescence and cell death pathways are major causes of aging phenotypes, such as organ atrophy, which appear to be pre-programmed responses of a sizable fraction of the cell population [6]. 6. **Accumulated Defects in Function**: Progressive changes in a cell or organism lead to accumulated defects in function, resulting in system failure and death [8]. 7. **Loss of Genomic Stability**: Loss of genomic stability due to reduced DNA repair capacities, loss of proliferative potential caused by increased senescence, and age-related alterations in DNA-methylation patterns that affect cellular plasticity [9].  These factors collectively contribute to the aging process and the associated decline in physiological functions.",
