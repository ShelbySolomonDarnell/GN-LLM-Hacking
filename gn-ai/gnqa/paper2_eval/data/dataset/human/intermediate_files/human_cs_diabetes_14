It has been shown that glucosestimu-lated insulin secretion may be triggered by the autocrine ac-tivation of the insulin signaling pathway, including insulin receptor phosphorylation, tyrosine phosphorylation in IRS1, and the activation of PI3Kinase. Putting together these data leads to the hypothesis that a single molecular impairment in the pathway of insulin signaling, including an incomplete interaction between",
    "(A) Insulin interacts in the liver to suppress glucose production, and in muscle and adipose tissue to stimulate uptake of glucose, aminoacids, and fatty acids. The amount of insulin released to maintain normal glucose homoeostasis is established by prevailing insulin sensitivity. This feedback is probably mediated through neuronal and humoral mechanisms, but exact mediators are still not known.

    "Insulin Action   In healthy, normal individuals, blood glucose concentra- tion is maintained within a narrow range. After an over-night fast or between meals, blood glucose normally falls within the range of 3.5  5.5   mM. Immediately after a meal containing carbohydrate, blood glucose concentration rises to a peak of 6  10   mM followed by a sharp decline back to baseline within 60 minutes. This exquisite control is achieved by a   ne balance between glucose absorption",

  "answer": "Insulin plays a central role in the regulation of blood glucose levels by facilitating the uptake of glucose into peripheral tissues and suppressing glucose production by the liver. When blood glucose levels rise, such as after food intake, insulin is secreted by the pancreas into the bloodstream [1]. This secretion stimulates peripheral tissues, including muscle and adipose tissue, to absorb glucose, thereby lowering blood glucose levels [1], [3], [8].   Insulin also acts in the liver to suppress glucose production and gluconeogenesis, further contributing to the reduction of blood glucose levels [3], [6], [8]. Additionally, insulin triggers the translocation of GLUT4 receptors to the cell surface in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, enhancing glucose uptake by these tissues [8]. This finely tuned balance between glucose absorption, production, and extraction ensures that blood glucose levels are maintained within a narrow range [4], [5].",
