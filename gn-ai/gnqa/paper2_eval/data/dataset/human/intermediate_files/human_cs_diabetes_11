For example, in the DiabetesPrevention Program (DPP; described in more detail later), both short- and intermediate-term weight loss were associated with reduced diabetes risk and intermediate cardiometabolic risk factor levels, whereas weight cycling (defined as number of 5 lb [2.25 kg] weight cycles) raised diabetes risk, fasting glucose levels, insulinresistance, and systolic blood pressure.

In a study of 5990 male  alumni from an American university followed over 10 years, 202 pts (3.3  percent) developed Type 2 diabetes mellitus. The relative risk was lower  in patients who exercised regularly even when adjusted for obesity,  hypertension, and a family history of diabetes. The benefit was greatest in",

  "answer": "Yes, cycling, as a form of physical activity, can reduce the risk of diabetes. According to the context provided:  - The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study found that higher levels of leisure activity, which primarily included cycling and walking, were associated with a 34% lower odds of developing hypertension over six years compared to the least active group. This study also indicated that physical activity reduces the risk of developing diabetes and hypertension through mechanisms involving changes in body weight and glucose tolerance [3]. - Additionally, other studies have shown that exercise, including activities like cycling, can prevent the development of Type 2 diabetes in high-risk groups [5].  Thus, engaging in regular cycling can contribute to a reduced risk of developing diabetes.",
