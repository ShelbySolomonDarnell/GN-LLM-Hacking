  "answer": "Mapping gene loci that control aging in humans is difficult due to several reasons:  1. **Complexity of the Phenotype**: Aging is a highly complex phenotype influenced by numerous genes and their interactions with environmental factors. This complexity makes it challenging to identify specific genetic loci that control aging [10].  2. **Multiple Pathophysiological Processes**: Multiple genes could mediate the aging process through various pathophysiological processes and diseases, adding layers of complexity to the genetic mapping [6].  3. **Rare vs. Common Variants**: Finding common genetic variants that account for the entire genetic component of human lifespan variability has proven difficult. If rare variants explain most of the genetic variation in aging, new genotyping techniques and analysis methods are required to identify these genes and pathways [3], [4].  4. **High Number of Loci**: There are more than 1000 loci that exhibit age-dependent changes in gene expression. Not all of these loci are causally involved in aging, making it a substantial challenge to sort out which ones are relevant [8].  5. **Species Differences**: Many loci that control aging in model organisms like Drosophila may not have the same effect on human aging. This lack of direct correlation between species complicates the identification of relevant human aging genes [1].  6. **Heritability and Genetic Variation**: While some fraction of human lifespan is heritable, the genetic variation contributing to aging is complex and involves numerous loci associated with age-related traits, further complicating the mapping process [7].  These factors collectively contribute to the difficulty in mapping gene loci that control aging in humans.",
