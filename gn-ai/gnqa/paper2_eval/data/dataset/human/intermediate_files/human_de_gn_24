  "answer": "In QTL (Quantitative Trait Loci) analyses, several genes have been identified as being associated with diabetes. Specifically:  1. **RASA1, Nnt, and PSK1** on chromosome 13 have been identified as candidate genes underlying diabetes-related traits [4]. 2. **PAX4** near the locus 7q32 has been identified in a genome-wide association study in a Chinese population as a susceptibility locus for type 2 diabetes [6]. 3. **Genes on chromosomes 8q24 and 7q11** have been associated with insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion, which are critical factors in the development of type 2 diabetes [2]. 4. **Genes on 5q11-q13 and 7q32** have been identified as significant susceptibility factors for type 1 diabetes [9].  These genes and loci are typically associated with diabetes in QTL analyses, highlighting the complex genetic architecture of the disease.",
