  "answer": "The provided context does not include specific instructions on how to add a new species to the GeneNetwork database. However, it does mention that data from multiple species have been integrated into GeneNetwork [1], [6]. This suggests that the process is possible, but the exact steps are not detailed in the given excerpts.  To add a new species to the GeneNetwork database, you may need to refer to the official GeneNetwork website (www.genenetwork.org) [5], [7], or contact their support team for detailed guidance. Additionally, reviewing the materials and methods information page linked to datasets in GeneNetwork [2] might provide further insights into the process.",
