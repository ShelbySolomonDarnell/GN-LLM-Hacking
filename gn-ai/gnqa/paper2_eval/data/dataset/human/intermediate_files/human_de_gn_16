  "answer": "For text and biological resources, it seems you are referring to adding web resources such as Ensembl to your system. This is evident from the context which mentions various web-based biological data management systems and genome browsers like BioMart, GBrowse, and Ensembl [1], [4]. These resources provide portals to current and archived public assemblies, as well as tools for searching and annotating genome assemblies [4], [6]. Therefore, it appears you are more focused on integrating web resources rather than books.",
  "question": "For text and biological resources, do you mean add some books (on biology stuff) or/and web resources (as ensembl) on your system?"
