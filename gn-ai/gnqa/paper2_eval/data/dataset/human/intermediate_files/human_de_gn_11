  "answer": "Once a sperm combines with an egg, the traits passed onto the resulting lifeform are determined by several genetic and epigenetic factors:  1. **Chromosomal Segments**: Individuals inherit a patchwork of chromosomal segments from maternal and paternal chromosomes, which are combined during fertilization to form the zygote [2].     2. **Mendelian Laws**: The Mendel laws of segregation and independent assortment play a crucial role. Each parent passes a randomly selected allele for a given trait to the offspring, ensuring genetic diversity [5].  3. **Gene Activation and Regulation**: The process of gene activation and regulation is complex and involves several mechanisms:    - **Imprinting**: Genes can be marked with small chemical tags that determine whether they are activated or remain inactive after fertilization, depending on whether the modification was made by the father (in the sperm) or the mother (in the egg) [3], [4].    - **Maternal Effect**: The mother can alter gene activity in her offspring via the placenta [4].    - **Cis-regulation**: Instructions encoded within the embryo's DNA can directly control if and when a nearby gene becomes activated [4].  4. **Epigenetic Marks**: Epigenetic marks, which are less constrained and can be maintained, affect gene expression and phenotype later in development [6].  These factors collectively determine how traits are passed onto the resulting lifeform after the sperm combines with the egg.",
