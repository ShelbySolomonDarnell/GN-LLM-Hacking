  "answer": "There are several types of diabetes. The classical classification includes type 1, type 2, other types, and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) [2]. Additionally, there are subtypes of adult-onset diabetes, including severe autoimmune diabetes (SAID), severe insulin-deficient diabetes (SIDD), severe insulin-resistant diabetes (SIRD), mild obesity-related diabetes (MOD), and mild age-related diabetes [4]. Monogenic diabetes, such as Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY), also exists [8]. Therefore, the main types of diabetes are:  1. Type 1 diabetes 2. Type 2 diabetes 3. Other types of diabetes 4. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) 5. Monogenic diabetes (e.g., MODY)  In summary, there are at least five main types of diabetes, with additional subtypes identified in recent studies.",
