  "answer": "The environment influences fertilization through various factors that can affect both the biological and genetic mechanisms involved. Here are some specific ways in which the environment can impact fertilization:  1. **Developmental Environment**: The developmental environment, which can span from weeks to years, is a significant source of environmental influence. This includes factors such as temperature, which can affect gene expression levels and potentially influence fertilization outcomes [1].  2. **Strain and Environmental Interactions**: There is an interaction between genetic strain and environmental factors that can influence fertilization rates. For example, the fertilization rate of frozen-thawed spermatozoa compared to fresh spermatozoa can be affected by these interactions, indicating that both intrinsic genetic factors and environmental conditions play a role [2], [7].  3. **Gene-by-Environment Interactions**: Behaviors and biological processes, including fertilization, are influenced by complex interactions between multiple genes and environmental factors. These interactions can be subtle and often uncontrollable, making it challenging to isolate the specific environmental factors at play [3], [4].  4. **Epigenetic Modifications**: Environmental factors such as diet, smoking, and assisted reproductive techniques can alter gene expression through epigenetic modifications like DNA methylation. These changes can impact the placental epigenome and, consequently, pregnancy development and fertilization success [6].  5. **Temperature and Other Environmental Factors**: Temperature has a genetic basis in its effect on sex determination, and interactions between temperature and genetic factors have been observed in several species. Other environmental factors such as pH, hypoxia, and social factors can also influence sex determination and potentially affect fertilization processes [10].  In summary, the environment influences fertilization through a combination of developmental conditions, genetic and environmental interactions, epigenetic modifications, and specific environmental factors like temperature and pH [1], [2], [3], [4], [6], [7], [10].",
