    "do you identify the responsible gene within a QTL that you have identified?  Generally, one starts by performing a strain survey to find two parental inbred  strains that have a markedly different trait. One can now look up many different  traits of inbred mice online at the Mouse Phenome Database ( http://phenome. jax.org/pub-cgi/phenome/mpdcgi?rtn=docs/home ).

    "because these strains have been genotyped at more than 14,000 markers, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). Hundreds of genes may lie within a QTL interval, so identifying the underlying genes requires complementary methods. One method is to use BXD gene expression data (a public resource at www.genenetwork.org) to screen for genes within the QTL interval whose expression correlates with the trait of interest [23].",

    "to date, only a small handful of genes have been definitively identified for complex traits.  Our own efforts to identify a causal gene were stymied by the compound nature of QTLs  and the high gene density  in Qrr1 , and in Vol8a . Furthermore, it is now becoming clear  that in addition to the canonical candidate genes, there are multiple spliced variants,  microRNAs, and epigenetic factors to be considered.

  "answer": "To determine which gene in your QTL is causal for the trait, you can follow these steps:  1. **Identify Candidate Genes**: Start by identifying candidate genes within the QTL interval. This can be done by looking at genes that are expressed in tissues likely to influence the traits of interest [6].  2. **Sequence Candidate Genes**: Sequence the cDNA of strong candidate genes to identify amino acid polymorphisms. This helps in detecting sequence differences in coding or regulatory regions between the two parental inbred strains [1], [6].  3. **Expression Studies**: Test for mRNA and protein expression differences in target tissues of the original strains used to detect the QTL. This will help refine the list of candidate genes [1].  4. **Fine Mapping**: Perform fine mapping of the QTL interval to shorten the list of plausible candidate polymorphisms [6].  5. **Correlation with Trait**: Use gene expression data to screen for genes within the QTL interval whose expression correlates with the trait of interest [7].  6. **Proof of Causality**: After refining the list of candidate genes, test them rigorously for proof of cause and effect. This involves proving definitively which nucleotide polymorphism underlies the QTL [1], [6].  By following these steps, you can systematically narrow down and identify the causal gene within your QTL.",
