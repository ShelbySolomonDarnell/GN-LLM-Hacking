  "answer": "Diabetes is classified into several types based on different criteria. The main types of diabetes are:  1. **Type 1 Diabetes (T1D)**: Also known as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) or juvenile onset diabetes, it is an autoimmune disease that usually occurs in childhood but can onset at any age [4], [6], [7].  2. **Type 2 Diabetes (T2D)**: Also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) or adult-onset diabetes, it is characterized by insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency [4], [6].  3. **Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM)**: This type occurs during pregnancy and is defined as any degree of glucose intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy [4].  4. **Other Types**: These include monogenic diabetes (such as maturity onset diabetes of the young [MODY], neonatal diabetes, mitochondrial diabetes), and syndromes of insulin resistance [5].  Additionally, a 2018 study identified five novel subtypes of adult-onset diabetes, which include severe autoimmune diabetes (SAID, including type 1 diabetes and latent autoimmune diabetes in adults [LADA]), severe insulin-deficient diabetes (SIDD), severe insulin-resistant diabetes (SIRD), mild obesity-related diabetes (MOD), and mild age-related diabetes [10].",
