  "answer": "The primary difference between QTL mapping and GWAS lies in their approaches and resolutions for identifying genetic associations with traits.  1. **QTL Mapping**:    - **Approach**: QTL mapping involves identifying segments of the genome (quantitative trait loci) that are associated with a particular phenotype. It typically uses linkage analysis to find statistically significant linkages between phenotypes and genotypes [7], [8].    - **Resolution**: Historically, QTL mapping has had low resolution, meaning it identifies larger genomic regions associated with traits rather than pinpointing specific genetic variants [6].  2. **GWAS (Genome-Wide Association Studies)**:    - **Approach**: GWAS is a holistic, whole-genome approach that analyzes the association between DNA polymorphisms and phenotypic traits across the entire genome. It establishes correlations between changes in DNA at specific loci and changes in disease traits within populations [2], [4].    - **Resolution**: GWAS allows for much finer mapping of QTLs compared to traditional linkage analysis, providing higher resolution in identifying specific genetic variants associated with traits [3].  In summary, while QTL mapping identifies broader genomic regions linked to traits with lower resolution, GWAS provides a finer, more detailed mapping of genetic associations across the entire genome [2], [3], [4], [6], [7], [8].",
