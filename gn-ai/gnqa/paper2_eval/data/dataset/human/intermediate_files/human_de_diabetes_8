  "answer": "To use the GeneNetwork tool to find genes related to diabetes in humans, you can follow these steps:  1. **Access the HumanNet Gene Network**: The HumanNet gene network can be accessed through its web interface at [http://www.functionalnet.org/humannet](http://www.functionalnet.org/humannet) [1].  2. **Search the Network**: Once you are on the HumanNet web interface, you can search the network using a set of seed genes. This allows you to explore the network for genes that are functionally related to your genes of interest, such as those involved in diabetes [1].  3. **Integrative Analysis**: You can perform integrative analysis to find genes and networks involved in diabetes. This involves combining data from various sources, such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and protein interaction networks, to identify candidate genes and protein network modules associated with diabetes [2], [4], [9].  4. **Review Network Data**: Consider network data that supports GWAS evidence. For example, network data has been used to add support to GWAS evidence for type 2 diabetes genes, measured as an increase in odds [1].  By following these steps, you can effectively use the GeneNetwork tool to identify and analyze genes related to diabetes in humans.",
