    "The biological processes linking aging and disease risk are poorly understood. Still, aging is considered to date as  one of the main factors responsible for several complex diseases including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes.

Recently, a nested case cohort study reported that an increased risk of type 2 diabetes is associ-",
    "The mechanisms leading to development of type 2 diabetes in young people are similar to those in older patients; however, the speed of onset, severity, and interplay of reduced insulin sensitivity and defective insulin secretion might be different in patients who develop the disease at a younger age. 18 In adolescents with type 2 diabetes, as in  later onset type 2 diabetes, the initial deterioration in -cell function is characterised by loss of first-phase nutrient-stimulated insulin secretion.",

    "T2D is associated with age, and Western populations are aging rapidly. The second major explanation is our lifestyles have changed dramatically in recent years. Epidemiological studies have identified strong T2D risk relationships for obesity, sedentary behavior [24], and diets rich in energy [5], processed carbohydrates [6], and animal fats [7]. Collectively, these lifestyle factors impede the actions of insulin and raise hepatic glucose production, which can result in the diminution of endog-enous",

Furthermore, evidence is accumulating that young-onset type 2 diabetes has a more aggressive disease phenotype,",

  "answer": "Aging is considered one of the main factors responsible for the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D) [1]. As populations in Western countries are aging rapidly, the prevalence of T2D is increasing [5]. This is partly due to lifestyle changes that impede insulin action and increase hepatic glucose production, which are more pronounced in older adults [5]. Additionally, the severity of insulin resistance tends to be greater in older individuals, especially those with a history of prolonged and severe obesity [7]. Therefore, aging significantly increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.",
