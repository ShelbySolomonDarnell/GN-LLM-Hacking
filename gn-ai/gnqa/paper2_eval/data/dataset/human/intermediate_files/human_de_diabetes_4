  "answer": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a global pandemic with increasing incidence worldwide, where nutrients and dietary patterns play a crucial role in its prevention, development, and treatment [1]. The pathogenesis of DM involves complex interactions between genetic predisposition and dietary factors, which are not yet fully understood [1]. Genomics offers a promising avenue to elucidate these interactions by studying nutrient-gene interactions at various levels [1]. Nutritional genomics, including nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics, focuses on how genetic variations affect nutrient metabolism and the body's response to nutrient intake, potentially influencing DM pathogenesis [3]. By identifying gene variants and understanding their interactions with dietary factors, genomics can help predict disease risk more accurately and facilitate the development of personalized dietary interventions [8]. This approach aims to develop tailored diets that maximize the use of nutrients and functional ingredients in food, aiding in the prevention and delay of DM and its complications [6]. Overall, genomics provides valuable insights into the role of gene-nutrient interactions in DM, paving the way for more effective prevention and treatment strategies [7].",
