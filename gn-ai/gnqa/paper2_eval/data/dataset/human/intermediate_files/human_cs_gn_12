In certain societies, individuals place greater importance on (and have greater knowledge about) one side of the family than another (unilineal descent). Thus, individuals in patrilineal groups trace relationships through males only so that your fathers brothers children are members of your family, but not your fathers sisters (Kottak, 2007 ). They are members of their husbands group or family. Efforts to create",

For example, if an offspring of the proband was a carrier of the DNM  allele and had haplotype sharing to paternal chromosome of the proband, we  assigned the mutation to the father. Meanwhile, if the offspring was not a DNM  allele carrier, we would assign it to the maternal germline. We restricted the haplo -",
    "Unlike the nuclear genome, which requires both paternal and maternal contributions, mtDNA is inherited solely from the maternal lineage. It is unclear what advantage a uniparental mtDNA transmission confers, but one possibil-ity is to minimize the number of distinct genomes to maxi-mize the efficiency of a multi-genomic system (Hill etal. 2019). In fact, humans have developed complex, redundant mechanisms to ensure uniparental inheritance of mtDNA (DeLuca and OFarrell 2012; Rojansky etal. 2016). Paternal",

All children inherit mtDNA from their mother, with no admixture from the father. Like Y-line DNA, mtDNA is passed intact from one generation to the next but through maternal line. Mitochondrial DNA does not follow any surname. In fact, the surname changes in every generation when women marry. Polymorphisms of mtDNA",
    "a family pedigree may be hampered if the participant is not familiar with her mothers relatives, but her mothers brothers children (her cousins) may be able to supplement her overall family history. Knowledge about the cultural system of unilineal descent avoids assuming the universality of bilateral descent. Cultural beliefs such as these also have implications in the conduct of genetic research in terms of confidentiality and autonomy (Benkendorf et al.,",

Figure 1e shows a strong relationship between the number of  paternal DNMs and the fathers age at conception (1.47 per year, 95%  CI 1.341.59) and a weaker impact of the mothers age on the number  of maternal DNMs (0.37 per year, 95% CI 0.300.45).

  "answer": "Genetic tracing is often matrilineal rather than patrilineal primarily because mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is inherited solely from the maternal lineage. Unlike the nuclear genome, which requires contributions from both parents, mtDNA is passed down from mother to offspring without any admixture from the father [4], [5]. This uniparental inheritance of mtDNA simplifies the tracing of maternal lineage as it remains relatively unchanged through generations, making it a reliable marker for genetic studies [4], [5]. Additionally, humans have developed complex mechanisms to ensure this uniparental inheritance of mtDNA, which further supports its use in genetic tracing [4].",
  "question": "Why is genetic tracing matrilineal rather than patrilineal?"
