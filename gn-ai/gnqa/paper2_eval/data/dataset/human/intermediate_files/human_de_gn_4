Currently, prenatal testing for chromosomal diseases has become increasingly common (Moyer et al., 1999). Options such as pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) can identify over 1,250 disease-related mutations creating an opportunity for parents to select unaffected embryos for implantation in the womb (R.

Abortion beliefs constitute a key issue in the decision-making process. Even though a majority of parents receiving abnormal prenatal test results terminate their pregnancies (Redlinger-Grosse,",

With thoughtful deliberation with health professionals, patients and  families, test developers and laboratories, insurers and other stakeholders, these issues can be  addressed to ensure the safe and appropriate use of these promising new clinical applications.

Ethical Considerations in Developing Policy for Comprehensive Genomic Testing In the near future, genomic testing is likely to become more accessible and will provide both information aboutthe risks of common conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension as well as predictions aboutindividual responses to specific pharmaceuticals and other medical therapies (Aspinall & Hamermesh, 2007)."

  "answer": "The ethical considerations surrounding prenatal genetic testing and the selective termination of pregnancies based on genetic factors are multifaceted and complex. Key considerations include:  1. **Parental Beliefs and Attitudes**: Decisions about prenatal testing and subsequent actions, such as termination, are heavily influenced by parental beliefs about abortion, attitudes regarding disability, and their perceptions of the usefulness of the information revealed by genetic tests [2]. These personal beliefs and attitudes play a crucial role in shaping the ethical landscape of prenatal genetic testing.  2. **Informed Consent**: Ensuring that parents are fully informed about the implications of genetic testing is critical. This includes understanding the potential outcomes, the accuracy of the tests, and the possible decisions they may face based on the results [4]. Informed consent is a cornerstone of ethical medical practice, particularly in the context of genetic testing.  3. **Respect for Parental Decision-Making**: Ethical considerations must balance clinical benefits and risks with respect for parental decision-making. Parents should generally have the final authority in making decisions about their children's health care, including whether to undergo genetic testing and how to respond to the results [5].  4. **Social and Psychological Implications**: The ability to predict future diseases through genetic testing, coupled with limited options for prevention or treatment, has significant social and psychological implications. These must be addressed to ensure that parents are not unduly burdened by the information provided by genetic tests [7].  5. **Access and Equity**: Ethical issues also arise from the accessibility of genetic testing and the opportunities it creates. There are concerns about equitable access to these technologies and the potential for disparities in who can benefit from them [1].  6. **Family Communication Challenges**: Genetic testing results can create communication challenges within families, as they navigate the complex information and make decisions that affect their future [1].  In summary, the ethical considerations surrounding prenatal genetic testing and selective termination involve respecting parental beliefs and decision-making, ensuring informed consent, addressing social and psychological impacts, and promoting equitable access to genetic testing technologies. These considerations must be carefully balanced to navigate the ethical complexities of prenatal genetic testing.",
