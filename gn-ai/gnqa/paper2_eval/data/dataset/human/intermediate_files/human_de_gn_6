The genes most strongly associated with T1D are loc ated in the HLA region of  chromosome 6 [128].  Similar to T1D, T2D has a stro ng genetic component.  To date,  more than 50 candidate genes for T2D have been inve stigated in various populations  worldwide.  Candidate genes are selected due to the ir interference with pancreatic",
