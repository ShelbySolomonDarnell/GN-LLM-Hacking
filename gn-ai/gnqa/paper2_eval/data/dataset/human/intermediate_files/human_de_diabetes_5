The association  of TCF7L2  gene variants with type 2 diabetes and  its mechanism of action received special attention  by several investigators[161,162]. Over expression of the protein was shown to decrease the sensitivity of  beta islet cells to secrete insulin[163,164] and was more  precisely involved in the regulation of secretary granule  fusion that constitute a late event in insulin secretion",

    "approximately double odds ratio compared to most other diabetes susceptibility polymorphisms. TCF7L2  is a transcription factor involved in the Wnt signaling pathway that is ubiquitously expressed,  and it has been observed that TCF7L2  risk alleles result in the overexpression of TCF7L2  in   pancreatic  cells. This overexpression causes reduced nutrient -induced insulin secretion, which results  in a direct predisposition to T2DM as well as an indirect predisp osition via an increase in hepatic glucose",
    "diabetes. The gene seems to be widely expressed [ 18] and the transcription factor product is known to be involved in the Wnt signalling cascade. Current evidence strongly supports the idea that the predominant effect of TCF7L2 dysfunction on type 2 diabetes development is mediated through impairment of insulin secretion [ 11,1517,20], a finding that would be consistent, for example, with theknown effects of other (non-homologous) TCF genes (TCF1 [also known as HNF1A ] and TCF2 [also known as"
  ],
  "answer": "Yes, the gene TCF7L2 is involved in diabetes, specifically type 2 diabetes. Multiple sources in the provided context confirm this association:  1. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in TCF7L2 are reproducibly associated with type 2 diabetes and reduce the insulin response to glucose in nondiabetic individuals [1]. 2. Common variants in the TCF7L2 gene increase the risk of type 2 diabetes [2]. 3. The TCF7L2 gene confers risk of type 2 diabetes [3], [4]. 4. Variants in the TCF7L2 gene are associated with a significant increase in type 2 diabetes risk, representing the strongest known genetic determinant of the disease [5]. 5. Overexpression of TCF7L2 protein decreases the sensitivity of beta islet cells to secrete insulin, which is involved in the regulation of insulin secretion [6]. 6. TCF7L2 risk alleles result in overexpression in pancreatic cells, causing reduced nutrient-induced insulin secretion and a predisposition to type 2 diabetes [9]. 7. The predominant effect of TCF7L2 dysfunction on type 2 diabetes development is mediated through impairment of insulin secretion [10].  These references collectively support the involvement of TCF7L2 in the pathogenesis and risk of type 2 diabetes.",
