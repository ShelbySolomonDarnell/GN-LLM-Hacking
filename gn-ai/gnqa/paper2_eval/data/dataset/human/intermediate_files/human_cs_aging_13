In such works, GenAge is an adequate resource asit provides a framework for the functional genomics of aging.For example, Xue   et     al  .

A previous paper used protein- protein interactions to build genetic networks identifying potential longevity genes along with links between genes and aging-related diseases [ 30].

The new GeneNetwork is now an exciting resource for  predictive medicine and systems genetics, which is constantly being maintained and improved.    Here, we give a brief overview of the process  for carrying out some of the most common  functions on GeneNetwork, as a gateway to deeper analyses , demonstrating how a small",

  "answer": "GeneNetwork is a resource that has been significantly updated and enhanced to include data from 10 species, multi-omics analysis, updated code, and new tools. It serves as an exciting resource for predictive medicine and systems genetics, constantly being maintained and improved [4].  In relation to aging research, GeneNetwork is used to study genetic networks and pathways linked with aging. For example, researchers use GeneNetwork to construct modular networks of aging, which can provide insights into how different genes interact and affect longevity and aging processes [1]. This network-based approach allows for the identification of potential longevity genes and the links between genes and aging-related diseases [3]. Thus, GeneNetwork plays a crucial role in the functional genomics of aging by enabling the analysis and visualization of complex genetic interactions and their implications for aging and longevity.",
