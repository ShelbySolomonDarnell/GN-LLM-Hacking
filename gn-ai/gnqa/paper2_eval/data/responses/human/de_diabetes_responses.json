              "content": "Gene expression in the liver is significantly affected by diabetes in several ways:\n\n1. **Hepatic Lipogenic Capacity**: In diabetic obese mice, gene expression profiles suggest a role of hepatic lipogenic capacity in diabetes susceptibility, indicating that genes involved in lipid metabolism are differentially expressed in the liver of diabetic individuals [1].\n\n2. **High Fat Feeding**: In diabetic Goto-Kakizaki rats, high fat feeding alters liver gene expression, which implies that dietary factors can further influence the gene expression changes associated with diabetes [2].\n\n3. **Variability of Gene Expression**: Diabetes increases the variability of gene expression levels in the liver, affecting the regulation of genes involved in both glucose and lipid metabolism [3], [4].\n\n4. **Glucose Homeostasis and Insulin Resistance**: The liver, along with skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, plays a crucial role in maintaining glucose homeostasis. Functional analysis of differentially expressed genes in the liver has identified networks of genes and potential regulators whose activation and inhibition could explain insulin resistance and dysglycemia in diabetic conditions [5], [6], [7], [8].\n\n5. **Carbohydrate Metabolism**: A glucose-responsive transcription factor that regulates carbohydrate metabolism in the liver is affected by diabetes, indicating changes in the expression of genes involved in glucose metabolism [9].\n\nOverall, diabetes leads to significant changes in the expression of genes in the liver, affecting pathways related to lipid and glucose metabolism, insulin resistance, and overall metabolic homeostasis.",

Nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics are fields that focus on how genetic variations affect nutrient metabolism and the body's response to nutrient intake, which can influence the development and progression of DM [3]. \n\nBy identifying gene variants that contribute to both fetal growth and susceptibility to Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), researchers can better understand how metabolic programming is partly genetically determined [2]. This understanding can help in predicting disease risk more accurately and developing personalized dietary recommendations to prevent and manage DM [4].\n\nMoreover, studying gene-nutrient interactions can reveal early molecular events in DM, contributing to the identification of better biomarkers and diagnostic tools [6]. This approach can also facilitate the development of tailored diets that maximize the use of nutrients and functional ingredients in food, aiding in the prevention and delay of DM and its complications [8]. \n\nOverall, genomics provides insights into how nutrients can affect gene expression through various mechanisms, such as directly, through their metabolites, or through signal transduction molecules [9]. This comprehensive understanding can lead to more effective prevention and treatment strategies for diabetes based on individual genetic profiles.",

Nutritional genomics, including nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics, focuses on how genetic variations affect nutrient metabolism and the body's response to nutrient intake, potentially influencing DM pathogenesis [3]. By identifying gene variants and understanding their interactions with dietary factors, genomics can help predict disease risk more accurately and facilitate the development of personalized dietary interventions [8]. This approach aims to develop tailored diets that maximize the use of nutrients and functional ingredients in food, aiding in the prevention and delay of DM and its complications [6].

These seed genes can be genes already known to be associated with diabetes or genes you are interested in exploring further [2].\n\n3. **Review Network Data**: The network data can provide additional support to genome-wide association studies (GWAS) evidence. For example, the network data can help measure the increase in odds for certain genes being associated with type 2 diabetes [2].\n\n4. **Integrative Analysis**: You can perform integrative analysis to find genes and networks involved in diabetes. This involves combining data from various sources to identify potential genetic interactions and pathways related to diabetes [4].\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively utilize GeneNetwork to identify and analyze genes related to diabetes in humans.",

This allows you to explore the network for genes that are functionally related to your genes of interest, such as those involved in diabetes [1].\n\n3. **Integrative Analysis**: You can perform integrative analysis to find genes and networks involved in diabetes. This involves combining data from various sources, such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and protein interaction networks, to identify candidate genes and protein network modules associated with diabetes [2], [4], [9].\n\n4. **Review Network Data**: Consider network data that supports GWAS evidence. For example, network data has been used to add support to GWAS evidence for type 2 diabetes genes, measured as an increase in odds [1].\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively use the GeneNetwork tool to identify and analyze genes related to diabetes in humans.",

For instance, viral infections have been shown to trigger immunoregulatory mechanisms that protect against T1D in animal models [1], [8].\n\n4. **Gut Microbiome and Autoimmunity**: The gut microbiome plays a significant role in the development of autoimmunity related to T1D. Alterations in gut microbiota networks have been observed in children with anti-islet cell autoimmunity, suggesting a link between gut health and immune responses in diabetes [3], [7].\n\n5. **Immune Pathogenesis in Complications**: Evidence supports an immune pathogenesis for diabetic complications such as autonomic neuropathy, where immune cells infiltrate autonomic ganglia, leading to nerve damage [10].\n\nIn summary, the immune system's malfunction, particularly through autoimmunity and altered immune responses, is a key factor in the development and progression of diabetes, especially T1D.",

For example, QTL profiles of 62 T1D GWAS loci grouped by cell populations reveal the distribution of p-values, indicating significant associations between these loci and immune cell traits [1].\n\n2. **Overlap with Immune-Related Phenotypes**: Many module-QTL loci overlap with GWAS hits for immune-related phenotypes, suggesting that these genetic modules are important in the context of inflammatory diseases, including diabetes [2].\n\n3. **Genetic Regulation of Immune Phenotypes**: QTL mapping in a study identified nine genome-wide significant QTLs associated with immune-cell proportions, including T cell subpopulations, indicating a genetic regulation of immune phenotypes in T1D [4].\n\n4. **Impact on Immune-Cell Populations**: Analysis of T1D GWAS loci showed suggestive associations between top SNPs and immune-cell traits, categorized into B cells, T cells, monocytes, and NK cells, further highlighting the impact of these loci on immune cell populations [5].\n\n5. **Comparative Analysis of Susceptibility Loci**: Comparative analysis of GWAS data sets for diseases like T1D, Crohn's disease (CD), and ulcerative colitis (UC) helps identify additional susceptibility loci and increases statistical power, which is crucial for understanding the genetic basis of immune-related complications in diabetes [6].\n\n6. **Pathway Identification**: The Immunochip effort has contributed to understanding disease mechanisms by identifying pathways linked to diabetes, which were not previously associated with the disease, indicating the complexity and diversity of diabetes and its immune-related aspects [7].\n\n7. **Functional Impacts of SNPs**: Although GWAS analyses do not automatically determine the specific genes associated with disease pathogenesis, they provide insights into how disease genes interact and affect immune parameters and functions [8], [9].\n\nIn summary, the integration of QTL and GWAS data provides valuable insights into the genetic regulation of immune phenotypes and their role in diabetes and its complications, supporting the use of these landscapes for dissecting the immune system's involvement in the disease.",
