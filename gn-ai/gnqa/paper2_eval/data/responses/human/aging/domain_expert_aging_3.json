  "answer": "Genetic factors associated with aging include:  1. **Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)**: These studies offer an unbiased approach to identify new candidate genes for human diseases, including those related to aging. Convergent results from multiple aging-related traits can point out the genes responsible for the general aging of the organism [2].  2. **Longevity-associated genes**: Dozens of genes have been associated with human longevity, although only a handful have shown consistent effects across populations. These genes are often related to specific biological pathways and processes [4].  3. **Genes involved in mitochondrial and proteasomal functions**: Aging is associated with alterations in the transcript levels of many genes, including those involved in evolutionarily conserved mitochondrial and proteasomal functions. Some of these genes have been shown to be directly involved in regulating lifespan [7].  4. **Genes with protective functions**: Certain genes that are overexpressed with age seem to have protective functions, helping organisms manage aging. These genes could be targets for manipulation to potentially influence the aging process [8].  These genetic factors highlight the complex interplay of various genes and pathways in the aging process.",
