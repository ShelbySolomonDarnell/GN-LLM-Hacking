Genes inducing cellular senescence tend to be overexpressed with age in human tissues and are significantly overrepresented in anti-longevity and tumor-suppressor genes, while genes inhibiting cellular senescence overlap with pro-longevity and oncogenes.

  "answer": "Genes typically associated with early aging include those involved in segmental progeroid syndromes, such as the Werner syndrome gene [2]. Additionally, genes critical in pathways previously related to aging, such as the insulin/insulin-like signaling pathway, are also associated with early aging [2].",
  "question": "which genes are typically associated with early aging?"
